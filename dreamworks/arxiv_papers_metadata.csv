Dataset Distillation for Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Vision Models,"The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.","['George Cazenavette', 'Antonio Torralba', 'Vincent Sitzmann']",2025-11-20 18:59:57+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16674v1,1549
Taming the Long-Tail: Efficient Reasoning RL Training with Adaptive Drafter,"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

Dexterity from Smart Lenses: Multi-Fingered Robot Manipulation with In-the-Wild Human Demonstrations,"Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

Solving Spatial Supersensing Without Spatial Supersensing,"Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims.

Evolution Strategies at the Hyperscale,"We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.","['Bidipta Sarkar', 'Mattie Fellows', 'Juan Agustin Duque', 'Alistair Letcher', 'Antonio León Villares', 'Anya Sims', 'Dylan Cope', 'Jarek Liesen', 'Lukas Seier', 'Theo Wolf', 'Uljad Berdica', 'Alexander David Goldie', 'Aaron Courville', 'Karin Sevegnani', 'Shimon Whiteson', 'Jakob Nicolaus Foerster']",2025-11-20 18:56:05+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16652v1,1755
Stabilizing Policy Gradient Methods via Reward Profiling,"Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.","['Shihab Ahmed', 'El Houcine Bergou', 'Aritra Dutta', 'Yue Wang']",2025-11-20 18:35:51+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16629v1,1128
From Polynomials to Databases: Arithmetic Structures in Galois Theory,"We develop a computational framework for classifying Galois groups of irreducible degree-7 polynomials over~$\mathbb{Q}$, combining explicit resolvent methods with machine learning techniques. A database of over one million normalized projective septics is constructed, each annotated with algebraic invariants~$J_0, \dots, J_4$ derived from binary transvections. For each polynomial, we compute resolvent factorizations to determine its Galois group among the seven transitive subgroups of~$S_7$ identified by Foulkes. Using this dataset, we train a neurosymbolic classifier that integrates invariant-theoretic features with supervised learning, yielding improved accuracy in detecting rare solvable groups compared to coefficient-based models. The resulting database provides a reproducible resource for constructive Galois theory and supports empirical investigations into group distribution under height constraints. The methodology extends to higher-degree cases and illustrates the utility of hybrid symbolic-numeric techniques in computational algebra.",['Jurgen Mezinaj'],2025-11-20 18:29:38+00:00,math.AC,2511.16622v1,1059
Rate-optimal community detection near the KS threshold via node-robust algorithms,"We study community detection in the \emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate
  \begin{equation*}
  \exp \Bigl(-\bigl(1 \pm o(1)\bigr) \tfrac{C}{k}\Bigr),
  \quad \text{where } C = (\sqrt{pn} - \sqrt{qn})^2,
  \end{equation*}
  whenever $C \ge K\,k^2\,\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\log k$ factor.
  Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $η\le \exp\bigl(- (1 \pm o(1)) \tfrac{C}{k}\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.
  To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].
  In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].
  Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.
  Our work has two key technical contributions:
  (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,
  (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.","['Jingqiu Ding', 'Yiding Hua', 'Kasper Lindberg', 'David Steurer', 'Aleksandr Storozhenko']",2025-11-20 18:11:01+00:00,stat.ML,2511.16613v1,1604
Time dependent loss reweighting for flow matching and diffusion models is theoretically justified,"This brief note clarifies that, in Generator Matching (which subsumes a large family of flow matching and diffusion models over continuous, manifold, and discrete spaces), both the Bregman divergence loss and the linear parameterization of the generator can depend on both the current state $X_t$ and the time $t$, and we show that the expectation over time in the loss can be taken with respect to a broad class of time distributions. We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons. We show examples that rely upon the dependence of linear parameterizations, and of the Bregman divergence loss, on $t$ and $X_t$.","['Lukas Billera', 'Hedwig Nora Nordlinder', 'Ben Murrell']",2025-11-20 17:55:21+00:00,stat.ML,2511.16599v1,1029
Variational Quantum Integrated Sensing and Communication,"The integration of sensing and communication functionalities within a common system is one of the main innovation drivers for next-generation networks. In this paper, we introduce a quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol that leverages entanglement in quantum carriers of information to enable both superdense coding and quantum sensing. The proposed approach adaptively optimizes encoding and quantum measurement via variational circuit learning, while employing classical machine learning-based decoders and estimators to process the measurement outcomes. Numerical results for qudit systems demonstrate that the proposed QISAC protocol can achieve a flexible trade-off between classical communication rate and accuracy of parameter estimation.","['Ivana Nikoloska', 'Osvaldo Simeone']",2025-11-20 17:50:34+00:00,quant-ph,2511.16597v1,769
Toward Artificial Palpation: Representation Learning of Touch on Soft Bodies,"Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.","['Zohar Rimon', 'Elisei Shafer', 'Tal Tepper', 'Efrat Shimron', 'Aviv Tamar']",2025-11-20 17:49:08+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16596v1,1159
gfnx: Fast and Scalable Library for Generative Flow Networks in JAX,"In this paper, we present gfnx, a fast and scalable package for training and evaluating Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) written in JAX. gfnx provides an extensive set of environments and metrics for benchmarking, accompanied with single-file implementations of core objectives for training GFlowNets.

Almost Sure Convergence Analysis of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Methods,"Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.","['Amartya Mukherjee', 'Jun Liu']",2025-11-20 17:42:40+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16587v1,1070
Synthesis of Safety Specifications for Probabilistic Systems,"Ensuring that agents satisfy safety specifications can be crucial in safety-critical environments. While methods exist for controller synthesis with safe temporal specifications, most existing methods restrict safe temporal specifications to probabilistic-avoidance constraints. Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem. Second, we leverage these results and propose a new Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for these more general temporal properties, and we prove the soundness and completeness of our method.","['Gaspard Ohlmann', 'Edwin Hamel-De le Court', 'Francesco Belardinelli']",2025-11-20 17:34:56+00:00,cs.LO,2511.16579v1,1112
"ECPv2: Fast, Efficient, and Scalable Global Optimization of Lipschitz Functions","We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.","['Fares Fourati', 'Mohamed-Slim Alouini', 'Vaneet Aggarwal']",2025-11-20 17:30:55+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16575v1,1231
An Exterior-Embedding Neural Operator Framework for Preserving Conservation Laws,"Neural operators have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in accelerating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning governing physical laws from data. However, for PDEs governed by conservation laws(e.g., conservation of mass, energy, or matter), existing neural operators fail to satisfy conservation properties, which leads to degraded model performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, we observe that distinct PDE problems generally require different optimal neural network architectures. This finding underscores the inherent limitations of specialized models in generalizing across diverse problem domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF), a universal conserving framework that can be integrated with various data-driven neural operators to enforce conservation laws strictly in predictions. The framework consists of two key components: a conservation quantity encoder that extracts conserved quantities from input data, and a conservation quantity decoder that adjusts the neural operator's predictions using these quantities to ensure strict conservation compliance in the final output. Since our architecture enforces conservation laws, we theoretically prove that it enhances model performance. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on multiple conservation-law-constrained PDE scenarios, including adiabatic systems, shallow water equations, and the Allen-Cahn problem. These baselines demonstrate that our method effectively improves model accuracy while strictly enforcing conservation laws in the predictions.","['Huanshuo Dong', 'Hong Wang', 'Hao Wu', 'Zhiwei Zhuang', 'Xuanze Yang', 'Ruiqi Shu', 'Yuan Gao', 'Xiaomeng Huang']",2025-11-20 17:29:19+00:00,cs.OH,2511.16573v1,1669
Boosting Predictive Performance on Tabular Data through Data Augmentation with Latent-Space Flow-Based Diffusion,"Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.","['Md. Tawfique Ihsan', 'Md.

Toward Valid Generative Clinical Trial Data with Survival Endpoints,"Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.","['Perrine Chassat', 'Van Tuan Nguyen', 'Lucas Ducrot', 'Emilie Lanoy', 'Agathe Guilloux']",2025-11-20 17:03:38+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16551v1,1498
Broad stochastic configuration residual learning system for norm-convergent universal approximation,"Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms.

FairLRF: Achieving Fairness through Sparse Low Rank Factorization,"As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.","['Yuanbo Guo', 'Jun Xia', 'Yiyu Shi']",2025-11-20 17:01:52+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16549v1,1594
The Oracle and The Prism: A Decoupled and Efficient Framework for Generative Recommendation Explanation,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage.
  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.
  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.","['Jiaheng Zhang', 'Daqiang Zhang']",2025-11-20 16:59:16+00:00,cs.IR,2511.16543v1,1350
Beyond Tokens in Language Models: Interpreting Activations through Text Genre Chunks,"Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.","['Éloïse Benito-Rodriguez', 'Einar Urdshals', 'Jasmina Nasufi', 'Nicky Pochinkov']",2025-11-20 16:53:12+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16540v1,714
Contrastive vision-language learning with paraphrasing and negation,"Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.","['Kwun Ho Ngan', 'Saman Sadeghi Afgeh', 'Joe Townsend', ""Artur d'Avila Garcez""]",2025-11-20 16:41:36+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16527v1,1863
Dynamic Participation in Federated Learning: Benchmarks and a Knowledge Pool Plugin,"Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.","['Ming-Lun Lee', 'Fu-Shiang Yang', 'Cheng-Kuan Lin', 'Yan-Ann Chen', 'Chih-Yu Lin', 'Yu-Chee Tseng']",2025-11-20 16:36:50+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16523v1,1424
Saving Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems,"Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.","['Yuxiang Wan', 'Ryan Devera', 'Wenjie Zhang', 'Ju Sun']",2025-11-20 16:35:57+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16520v1,676
Loss Functions Robust to the Presence of Label Errors,"Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.","['Nicholas Pellegrino', 'David Szczecina', 'Paul Fieguth']",2025-11-20 16:30:55+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16512v1,727
ODE-ViT: Plug & Play Attention Layer from the Generalization of the ViT as an Ordinary Differential Equation,"In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.","['Carlos Boned Riera', 'David Romero Sanchez', 'Oriol Ramos Terrades']",2025-11-20 16:19:41+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16501v1,1162
Large Language Model-Based Reward Design for Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Autonomous Cyber Defense,"Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.","['Sayak Mukherjee', 'Samrat Chatterjee', 'Emilie Purvine', 'Ted Fujimoto', 'Tegan Emerson']",2025-11-20 15:54:08+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16483v1,864
Correlation-Aware Feature Attribution Based Explainable AI,"Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.","['Poushali Sengupta', 'Yan Zhang', 'Frank Eliassen', 'Sabita Maharjan']",2025-11-20 15:51:00+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16482v1,1638
Limitations of Scalarisation in MORL: A Comparative Study in Discrete Environments,"Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.","[""Muhammad Sa'ood Shah"", 'Asad Jeewa']",2025-11-20 15:45:50+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16476v1,1535
A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms,"The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.","['Ali Murtaza Caunhye', 'Asad Jeewa']",2025-11-20 15:44:11+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16475v1,1817
Optimizing Quantum Key Distribution Network Performance using Graph Neural Networks,"This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.","['Akshit Pramod Anchan', 'Ameiy Acharya', 'Leki Chom Thungon']",2025-11-20 15:36:57+00:00,quant-ph,2511.16468v1,1519
Anatomy of an Idiom: Tracing Non-Compositionality in Language Models,"We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.",['Andrew Gomes'],2025-11-20 15:35:50+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16467v1,884
PersonaDrift: A Benchmark for Temporal Anomaly Detection in Language-Based Dementia Monitoring,"People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.","['Joy Lai', 'Alex Mihailidis']",2025-11-20 15:15:00+00:00,cs.AI,2511.16445v1,1867
Graph Neural Networks for Surgical Scene Segmentation,"Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.","['Yihan Li', 'Nikhil Churamani', 'Maria Robu', 'Imanol Luengo', 'Danail Stoyanov']",2025-11-20 14:58:29+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16430v1,1729
Generative Modeling of Clinical Time Series via Latent Stochastic Differential Equations,"Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.","['Muhammad Aslanimoghanloo', 'Ahmed ElGazzar', 'Marcel van Gerven']",2025-11-20 14:50:49+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16427v1,1644
FreqFlow: Long-term forecasting using lightweight flow matching,"Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods","['Seyed Mohamad Moghadas', 'Bruno Cornelis', 'Adrian Munteanu']",2025-11-20 14:50:13+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16426v1,1869
"Classification of worldwide news articles by perceived quality, 2018-2024","This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC.

Collaborative Management for Chronic Diseases and Depression: A Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning Method,"Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.","['Yidong Chai', 'Haoxin Liu', 'Jiaheng Xie', 'Chaopeng Wang', 'Xiao Fang']",2025-11-20 14:15:27+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16398v1,1806
Optimal Fairness under Local Differential Privacy,"We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.","['Hrad Ghoukasian', 'Shahab Asoodeh']",2025-11-20 14:00:15+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16377v1,1227

Our pipeline integrates two main components: (1) A GNN-based agent, trained in an unsupervised manner to generate initial color predictions, which are refined by (2) refinement strategies (a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing) that together enhance solution quality and balance.

VersaPants: A Loose-Fitting Textile Capacitive Sensing System for Lower-Body Motion Capture,"We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.","['Deniz Kasap', 'Taraneh Aminosharieh Najafi', 'Jérôme Paul Rémy Thevenot', 'Jonathan Dan', 'Stefano Albini', 'David Atienza']",2025-11-20 13:30:02+00:00,eess.SP,2511.16346v1,1626

"Beyond Generative AI: World Models for Clinical Prediction, Counterfactuals, and Planning","Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration.

Learning-Enhanced Observer for Linear Time-Invariant Systems with Parametric Uncertainty,"This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

Sparse Autoencoders are Topic Models,"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.","['Leander Girrbach', 'Zeynep Akata']",2025-11-20 12:37:54+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16309v1,1070
Optimizing Operation Recipes with Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Interpretable Control of Chemical Processes,"Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.","['Dean Brandner', 'Sergio Lucia']",2025-11-20 12:24:37+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16297v1,1615
Spectral Identifiability for Interpretable Probe Geometry,"Linear probes are widely used to interpret and evaluate neural representations, yet their reliability remains unclear, as probes may appear accurate in some regimes but collapse unpredictably in others. We uncover a spectral mechanism behind this phenomenon and formalize it as the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), a verifiable Fisher-inspired condition for probe stability. When the eigengap separating task-relevant directions is larger than the Fisher estimation error, the estimated subspace concentrates and accuracy remains consistent, whereas closing this gap induces instability in a phase-transition manner. Our analysis connects eigengap geometry, sample size, and misclassification risk through finite-sample reasoning, providing an interpretable diagnostic rather than a loose generalization bound. Controlled synthetic studies, where Fisher quantities are computed exactly, confirm these predictions and show how spectral inspection can anticipate unreliable probes before they distort downstream evaluation.",['William Hao-Cheng Huang'],2025-11-20 12:09:42+00:00,stat.ML,2511.16288v1,1030
Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation,"Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.","['David Bechtoldt', 'Sidney Bender']",2025-11-20 12:06:53+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16287v1,1015
GeoPTH: A Lightweight Approach to Category-Based Trajectory Retrieval via Geometric Prototype Trajectory Hashing,"Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.","['Yang Xu', 'Zuliang Yang', 'Kai Ming Ting']",2025-11-20 11:37:25+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16258v1,1366
"Pass@k Metric for RLVR: A Diagnostic Tool of Exploration, But Not an Objective","The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of ""exploration collapse"", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.",['Yang Yu'],2025-11-20 10:58:21+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16231v1,1217
Deep SOR Minimax Q-learning for Two-player Zero-sum Game,"In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.","['Saksham Gautam', 'Lakshmi Mandal', 'Shalabh Bhatnagar']",2025-11-20 10:52:42+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16226v1,1092
Real-Time Inference for Distributed Multimodal Systems under Communication Delay Uncertainty,"Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.","['Victor Croisfelt', 'João Henrique Inacio de Souza', 'Shashi Raj Pandey', 'Beatriz Soret', 'Petar Popovski']",2025-11-20 10:48:54+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16225v1,971
Mind the Gap: Bridging Prior Shift in Realistic Few-Shot Crop-Type Classification,"Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.","['Joana Reuss', 'Ekaterina Gikalo', 'Marco Körner']",2025-11-20 10:39:25+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16218v1,1044
FlipVQA-Miner: Cross-Page Visual Question-Answer Mining from Textbooks,"The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

Towards Overcoming Data Scarcity in Nuclear Energy: A Study on Critical Heat Flux with Physics-consistent Conditional Diffusion Model,"Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.","['Farah Alsafadi', 'Alexandra Akins', 'Xu Wu']",2025-11-20 10:19:03+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16207v1,1735
Causal Synthetic Data Generation in Recruitment,"The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.","['Andrea Iommi', 'Antonio Mastropietro', 'Riccardo Guidotti', 'Anna Monreale', 'Salvatore Ruggieri']",2025-11-20 10:14:33+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16204v1,1439
A Switching Framework for Online Interval Scheduling with Predictions,"We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.","['Antonios Antoniadis', 'Ali Shahheidar', 'Golnoosh Shahkarami', 'Abolfazl Soltani']",2025-11-20 10:01:09+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16194v1,1279
ART: A Graph-based Framework for Investigating Illicit Activity in Monero via Address-Ring-Transaction Structures,"As Law Enforcement Agencies advance in cryptocurrency forensics, criminal actors aiming to conceal illicit fund movements increasingly turn to ""mixin"" services or privacy-based cryptocurrencies. Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi.

We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics.

Achieving Skilled and Reliable Daily Probabilistic Forecasts of Wind Power at Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Timescales over France,"Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts.

Approximation rates of quantum neural networks for periodic functions via Jackson's inequality,"Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.","['Ariel Neufeld', 'Philipp Schmocker', 'Viet Khoa Tran']",2025-11-20 08:44:24+00:00,quant-ph,2511.16149v1,1121

Labels Matter More Than Models: Quantifying the Benefit of Supervised Time Series Anomaly Detection,"Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts.

Angular Graph Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application,"Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.","['Feiyue Zhao', 'Yangfan He', 'Zhichao Zhang']",2025-11-20 07:13:27+00:00,stat.ML,2511.16111v1,1678
Pathlet Variational Auto-Encoder for Robust Trajectory Generation,"Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.","['Yuanbo Tang', 'Yan Tang', 'Zixuan Zhang', 'Zihui Zhao', 'Yang Li']",2025-11-20 06:57:27+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16105v1,1758
HybSpecNet: A Critical Analysis of Architectural Instability in Hybrid-Domain Spectral GNNs,"Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental ""Stability-vs-Adaptivity"" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a ""naive"" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as ""Instability Poisoning,"" where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses ""Late Fusion"" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.",['Huseyin Goksu'],2025-11-20 06:47:44+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16101v1,1915
Mitigating Estimation Bias with Representation Learning in TD Error-Driven Regularization,"Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.","['Haohui Chen', 'Zhiyong Chen', 'Aoxiang Liu', 'Wentuo Fang']",2025-11-20 06:31:55+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16090v1,1116
AssayMatch: Learning to Select Data for Molecular Activity Models,"The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

"L-JacobiNet and S-JacobiNet: An Analysis of Adaptive Generalization, Stabilization, and Spectral Domain Trade-offs in GNNs","Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the ""Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter"" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.",['Huseyin Goksu'],2025-11-20 06:17:02+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16081v1,1141
Operon: Incremental Construction of Ragged Data via Named Dimensions,"Modern data processing workflows frequently encounter ragged data: collections with variable-length elements that arise naturally in domains like natural language processing, scientific measurements, and autonomous AI agents. Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.","['Sungbin Moon', 'Jiho Park', 'Suyoung Hwang', 'Donghyun Koh', 'Seunghyun Moon', 'Minhyeong Lee']",2025-11-20 06:16:31+00:00,cs.PL,2511.16080v1,1569
A Mathematical Framework for Custom Reward Functions in Job Application Evaluation using Reinforcement Learning,"Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable ""gentle polishing process"" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.","['Shreyansh Jain', 'Madhav Singhvi', 'Shreya Rahul Jain', 'Pranav S', 'Dishaa Lokesh', 'Naren Chittibabu', 'Akash Anandhan']",2025-11-20 06:06:30+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16073v1,1648
ILoRA: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation for Heterogeneous Client Aggregation,"Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.","['Junchao Zhou', 'Junkang Liu', 'Fanhua Shang']",2025-11-20 05:59:37+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16069v1,1132
Gauge-Equivariant Graph Networks via Self-Interference Cancellation,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing.

Change-of-Basis Pruning via Rotational Invariance,"Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.","['Alex Ning', 'Vainateya Rangaraju']",2025-11-20 05:45:19+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16061v1,1790
Agent0: Unleashing Self-Evolving Agents from Zero Data via Tool-Integrated Reasoning,"Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

HGCN2SP: Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network for Two-Stage Stochastic Programming,"Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.","['Yang Wu', 'Yifan Zhang', 'Zhenxing Liang', 'Jian Cheng']",2025-11-20 04:17:08+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16027v1,1291
Towards a Safer and Sustainable Manufacturing Process: Material classification in Laser Cutting Using Deep Learning,"Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.","['Mohamed Abdallah Salem', 'Hamdy Ahmed Ashur', 'Ahmed Elshinnawy']",2025-11-20 04:15:38+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16026v1,1382
CARE: Turning LLMs Into Causal Reasoning Expert,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.","['Juncheng Dong', 'Yiling Liu', 'Ahmed Aloui', 'Vahid Tarokh', 'David Carlson']",2025-11-20 03:34:16+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16016v1,1521
Physics-Guided Inductive Spatiotemporal Kriging for PM2.5 with Satellite Gradient Constraints,"High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.","['Shuo Wang', 'Mengfan Teng', 'Yun Cheng', 'Lothar Thiele', 'Olga Saukh', 'Shuangshuang He', 'Yuanting Zhang', 'Jiang Zhang', 'Gangfeng Zhang', 'Xingyuan Yuan', 'Jingfang Fan']",2025-11-20 03:18:41+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16013v1,1476
Synergizing Deconfounding and Temporal Generalization For Time-series Counterfactual Outcome Estimation,"Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.","['Yiling Liu', 'Juncheng Dong', 'Chen Fu', 'Wei Shi', 'Ziyang Jiang', 'Zhigang Hua', 'David Carlson']",2025-11-20 03:06:19+00:00,cs.LG,2511.16006v1,1760
Digital Agriculture Sandbox for Collaborative Research,"Digital agriculture is transforming the way we grow food by utilizing technology to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive. This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.","['Osama Zafar', 'Rosemarie Santa González', 'Alfonso Morales', 'Erman Ayday']",2025-11-20 02:41:35+00:00,cs.CR,2511.15990v1,1460
Fairness in Multi-modal Medical Diagnosis with Demonstration Selection,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.","['Dawei Li', 'Zijian Gu', 'Peng Wang', 'Chuhan Song', 'Zhen Tan', 'Mohan Zhang', 'Tianlong Chen', 'Yu Tian', 'Song Wang']",2025-11-20 02:38:00+00:00,cs.CV,2511.15986v1,1157
Descend or Rewind? Stochastic Gradient Descent Unlearning,"Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete"" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete"" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning"" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.","['Siqiao Mu', 'Diego Klabjan']",2025-11-20 02:29:39+00:00,cs.LG,2511.15983v1,1414
Machine Learning Epidemic Predictions Using Agent-based Wireless Sensor Network Models,"The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data.

Efficient Chromosome Parallelization for Precision Medicine Genomic Workflows,"Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.","['Daniel Mas Montserrat', 'Ray Verma', 'Míriam Barrabés', 'Francisco M. de la Vega', 'Carlos D.

Self-supervised and Multi-fidelity Learning for Extended Predictive Soil Spectroscopy,"We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.","['Luning Sun', 'José L.

Machine Learning vs. Randomness: Challenges in Predicting Binary Options Movements,"Binary options trading is often marketed as a field where predictive models can generate consistent profits.

Furthermore, several neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, were evaluated under different training conditions. Despite these exhaustive efforts, none of the models surpassed the ZeroR baseline accuracy, highlighting the inherent randomness of binary options. These findings reinforce the notion that binary options lack predictable patterns, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting.","['Gabriel M. Arantes', 'Richard F.

DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.","['Vaibhav Singh', 'Oleksiy Ostapenko', 'Pierre-André Noël', 'Torsten Scholak']",2025-11-19 23:23:49+00:00,cs.LG,2511.15927v1,987
AccelOpt: A Self-Improving LLM Agentic System for AI Accelerator Kernel Optimization,"We present AccelOpt, a self-improving large language model (LLM) agentic system that autonomously optimizes kernels for emerging AI acclerators, eliminating the need for expert-provided hardware-specific optimization knowledge. AccelOpt explores the kernel optimization space through iterative generation, informed by an optimization memory that curates experiences and insights from previously encountered slow-fast kernel pairs. We build NKIBench, a new benchmark suite of AWS Trainium accelerator kernels with varying complexity extracted from real-world LLM workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of AccelOpt. Our evaluation confirms that AccelOpt's capability improves over time, boosting the average percentage of peak throughput from $49\%$ to $61\%$ on Trainium 1 and from $45\%$ to $59\%$ on Trainium 2 for NKIBench kernels. Moreover, AccelOpt is highly cost-effective: using open-source models, it matches the kernel improvements of Claude Sonnet 4 while being $26\times$ cheaper.","['Genghan Zhang', 'Shaowei Zhu', 'Anjiang Wei', 'Zhenyu Song', 'Allen Nie', 'Zhen Jia', 'Nandita Vijaykumar', 'Yida Wang', 'Kunle Olukotun']",2025-11-19 22:49:37+00:00,cs.LG,2511.15915v1,991
Unified all-atom molecule generation with neural fields,"Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation.

EEG Emotion Recognition Through Deep Learning,"An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...","['Roman Dolgopolyi', 'Antonis Chatzipanagiotou']",2025-11-19 22:14:05+00:00,eess.SP,2511.15902v1,1521
Global Resolution: Optimal Multi-Draft Speculative Sampling via Convex Minimization,"Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.","['Rahul Krishna Thomas', 'Arka Pal']",2025-11-19 21:59:43+00:00,cs.LG,2511.15898v1,1694
Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes,"Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.","['Yintao Ma', 'Sajjad Pakdamansavoji', 'Amir Rasouli', 'Tongtong Cao']",2025-11-19 21:22:08+00:00,cs.CV,2511.15884v1,1373
Dataset Distillation for Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Vision Models,"The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.","['George Cazenavette', 'Antonio Torralba', 'Vincent Sitzmann']",2025-11-20 18:59:57+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16674v1,1549
EvoLMM: Self-Evolving Large Multimodal Models with Continuous Rewards,"Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

NoPo-Avatar: Generalizable and Animatable Avatars from Sparse Inputs without Human Poses,"We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate ""ground-truth"" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).","['Jing Wen', 'Alexander G.

Thinking-while-Generating: Interleaving Textual Reasoning throughout Visual Generation,"Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation.

Learning to Think Fast and Slow for Visual Language Models,"When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.","['Chenyu Lin', 'Cheng Chi', 'Jinlin Wu', 'Sharon Li', 'Kaiyang Zhou']",2025-11-20 18:59:48+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16670v1,1391
Video-as-Answer: Predict and Generate Next Video Event with Joint-GRPO,"While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

V-ReasonBench: Toward Unified Reasoning Benchmark Suite for Video Generation Models,"Recent progress in generative video models, such as Veo-3, has shown surprising zero-shot reasoning abilities, creating a growing need for systematic and reliable evaluation. We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.","['Yang Luo', 'Xuanlei Zhao', 'Baijiong Lin', 'Lingting Zhu', 'Liyao Tang', 'Yuqi Liu', 'Ying-Cong Chen', 'Shengju Qian', 'Xin Wang', 'Yang You']",2025-11-20 18:59:42+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16668v1,1082
SceneDesigner: Controllable Multi-Object Image Generation with 9-DoF Pose Manipulation,"Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

TriDiff-4D: Fast 4D Generation through Diffusion-based Triplane Re-posing,"With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.","['Eddie Pokming Sheung', 'Qihao Liu', 'Wufei Ma', 'Prakhar Kaushik', 'Jianwen Xie', 'Alan Yuille']",2025-11-20 18:59:03+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16662v1,1588
PartUV: Part-Based UV Unwrapping of 3D Meshes,"UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Solving Spatial Supersensing Without Spatial Supersensing,"Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims.

Teacher-Guided One-Shot Pruning via Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation,"Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.","['Md.

Late-decoupled 3D Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation with Semantic Prototype Discrimination based Bi-branch Supervision,"3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.","['Shuyu Cao', 'Chongshou Li', 'Jie Xu', 'Tianrui Li', 'Na Zhao']",2025-11-20 18:54:31+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16650v1,1574
TRIM: Scalable 3D Gaussian Diffusion Inference with Temporal and Spatial Trimming,"Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.","['Guolin Huang', 'Wenting Chen', 'Jiaqi Yang', 'Xinheng Lyu', 'Xiaoling Luo', 'Sen Yang', 'Xiaohan Xing', 'Linlin Shen']",2025-11-20 18:41:44+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16635v1,1435
SAM 3D: 3Dfy Anything in Images,"We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale.

SAM2S: Segment Anything in Surgical Videos via Semantic Long-term Tracking,"Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

TimeViper: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision-Language Model for Efficient Long Video Understanding,"We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.","['Boshen Xu', 'Zihan Xiao', 'Jiaze Li', 'Jianzhong Ju', 'Zhenbo Luo', 'Jian Luan', 'Qin Jin']",2025-11-20 17:48:21+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16595v1,1353
Green Resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems: Doctoral Dissertation,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.",['Diaeddin Rimawi'],2025-11-20 17:46:41+00:00,cs.SE,2511.16593v1,1906
Erase to Retain: Low Rank Adaptation Guided Selective Unlearning in Medical Segmentation Networks,"The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.","['Nirjhor Datta', 'Md.

POMA-3D: The Point Map Way to 3D Scene Understanding,"In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

NutriScreener: Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Pose Graph Attention Network for Malnourishment Screening,"Child malnutrition remains a global crisis, yet existing screening methods are laborious and poorly scalable, hindering early intervention. In this work, we present NutriScreener, a retrieval-augmented, multi-pose graph attention network that combines CLIP-based visual embeddings, class-boosted knowledge retrieval, and context awareness to enable robust malnutrition detection and anthropometric prediction from children's images, simultaneously addressing generalizability and class imbalance. In a clinical study, doctors rated it 4.3/5 for accuracy and 4.6/5 for efficiency, confirming its deployment readiness in low-resource settings. Trained and tested on 2,141 children from AnthroVision and additionally evaluated on diverse cross-continent populations, including ARAN and an in-house collected CampusPose dataset, it achieves 0.79 recall, 0.82 AUC, and significantly lower anthropometric RMSEs, demonstrating reliable measurement in unconstrained pediatric settings. Cross-dataset results show up to 25% recall gain and up to 3.5 cm RMSE reduction using demographically matched knowledge bases.

Lite Any Stereo: Efficient Zero-Shot Stereo Matching,"Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.","['Junpeng Jing', 'Weixun Luo', 'Ye Mao', 'Krystian Mikolajczyk']",2025-11-20 17:07:06+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16555v1,1039
Progressive Supernet Training for Efficient Visual Autoregressive Modeling,"Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the ""next-scale"" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.","['Xiaoyue Chen', 'Yuling Shi', 'Kaiyuan Li', 'Huandong Wang', 'Yong Li', 'Xiaodong Gu', 'Xinlei Chen', 'Mingbao Lin']",2025-11-20 16:59:24+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16546v1,1630
EOGS++: Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting with Internal Camera Refinement and Direct Panchromatic Rendering,"Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting.

Supervised Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot AI-Generated Image Detection and Attribution,"The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.","['Jaime Álvarez Urueña', 'David Camacho', 'Javier Huertas Tato']",2025-11-20 16:53:24+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16541v1,1830

Enhancing Multi-Camera Gymnast Tracking Through Domain Knowledge Integration,"We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.","['Fan Yang', 'Shigeyuki Odashima', 'Shoichi Masui', 'Ikuo Kusajima', 'Sosuke Yamao', 'Shan Jiang']",2025-11-20 16:47:45+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16532v1,1781
Contrastive vision-language learning with paraphrasing and negation,"Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.","['Kwun Ho Ngan', 'Saman Sadeghi Afgeh', 'Joe Townsend', ""Artur d'Avila Garcez""]",2025-11-20 16:41:36+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16527v1,1863

YOWO: You Only Walk Once to Jointly Map An Indoor Scene and Register Ceiling-mounted Cameras,"Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.","['Fan Yang', 'Sosuke Yamao', 'Ikuo Kusajima', 'Atsunori Moteki', 'Shoichi Masui', 'Shan Jiang']",2025-11-20 16:36:16+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16521v1,1533

Acquisition Time-Informed Breast Tumor Segmentation from Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI,"Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.","['Rui Wang', 'Yuexi Du', 'John Lewin', 'R.

Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Efficient Sim-to-Real Data Augmentation in Micro-Object Pose Estimation,"Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data.

Flow and Depth Assisted Video Prediction with Latent Transformer,"Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.","['Eliyas Suleyman', 'Paul Henderson', 'Eksan Firkat', 'Nicolas Pugeault']",2025-11-20 15:54:33+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16484v1,1237

Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.","['Doriand Petit', 'Steve Bourgeois', 'Vincent Gay-Bellile', 'Florian Chabot', 'Loïc Barthe']",2025-11-20 15:22:22+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16454v1,874
VLA-Pruner: Temporal-Aware Dual-Level Visual Token Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Inference,"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.","['Ziyan Liu', 'Yeqiu Chen', 'Hongyi Cai', 'Tao Lin', 'Shuo Yang', 'Zheng Liu', 'Bo Zhao']",2025-11-20 15:16:09+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16449v1,1653
StreetView-Waste: A Multi-Task Dataset for Urban Waste Management,"Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.","['Diogo J.

Beyond Visual Cues: Leveraging General Semantics as Support for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.","['Jin Wang', 'Bingfeng Zhang', 'Jian Pang', 'Mengyu Liu', 'Honglong Chen', 'Weifeng Liu']",2025-11-20 15:04:53+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16435v1,1477
Graph Neural Networks for Surgical Scene Segmentation,"Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.","['Yihan Li', 'Nikhil Churamani', 'Maria Robu', 'Imanol Luengo', 'Danail Stoyanov']",2025-11-20 14:58:29+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16430v1,1729
CylinderDepth: Cylindrical Spatial Attention for Multi-View Consistent Self-Supervised Surround Depth Estimation,"Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.","['Samer Abualhanud', 'Christian Grannemann', 'Max Mehltretter']",2025-11-20 14:55:28+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16428v1,1204
End-to-End Motion Capture from Rigid Body Markers with Geodesic Loss,"Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.","['Hai Lan', 'Zongyan Li', 'Jianmin Hu', 'Jialing Yang', 'Houde Dai']",2025-11-20 14:43:05+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16418v1,1215
CAMS: Towards Compositional Zero-Shot Learning via Gated Cross-Attention and Multi-Space Disentanglement,"Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

DetailSemNet: Elevating Signature Verification through Detail-Semantic Integration,"Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.","['Meng-Cheng Shih', 'Tsai-Ling Huang', 'Yu-Heng Shih', 'Hong-Han Shuai', 'Hsuan-Tung Liu', 'Yi-Ren Yeh', 'Ching-Chun Huang']",2025-11-20 13:49:27+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16364v1,1489
Multi-Order Matching Network for Alignment-Free Depth Super-Resolution,"Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.","['Zhengxue Wang', 'Zhiqiang Yan', 'Yuan Wu', 'Guangwei Gao', 'Xiang Li', 'Jian Yang']",2025-11-20 13:44:51+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16361v1,1372
CRISTAL: Real-time Camera Registration in Static LiDAR Scans using Neural Rendering,"Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.","['Joni Vanherck', 'Steven Moonen', 'Brent Zoomers', 'Kobe Werner', 'Jeroen Put', 'Lode Jorissen', 'Nick Michiels']",2025-11-20 13:34:34+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16349v1,966
Aerial View River Landform Video segmentation: A Weakly Supervised Context-aware Temporal Consistency Distillation Approach,"The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale Face Super-Resolution with Implicit Representation Networks,"Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.","['Yi Ting Tsai', 'Yu Wei Chen', 'Hong-Han Shuai', 'Ching-Chun Huang']",2025-11-20 13:21:58+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16341v1,1130
ChangeDINO: DINOv3-Driven Building Change Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery,"Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

WWE-UIE: A Wavelet & White Balance Efficient Network for Underwater Image Enhancement,"Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component.

NaTex: Seamless Texture Generation as Latent Color Diffusion,"We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.","['Zeqiang Lai', 'Yunfei Zhao', 'Zibo Zhao', 'Xin Yang', 'Xin Huang', 'Jingwei Huang', 'Xiangyu Yue', 'Chunchao Guo']",2025-11-20 12:47:22+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16317v1,1702

Sparse Autoencoders are Topic Models,"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities.

Upsample Anything: A Simple and Hard to Beat Baseline for Feature Upsampling,"We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.","['Minseok Seo', 'Mark Hamilton', 'Changick Kim']",2025-11-20 12:27:53+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16301v1,1208
Optimizing 3D Gaussian Splattering for Mobile GPUs,"Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.","['Md Musfiqur Rahman Sanim', 'Zhihao Shu', 'Bahram Afsharmanesh', 'AmirAli Mirian', 'Jiexiong Guan', 'Wei Niu', 'Bin Ren', 'Gagan Agrawal']",2025-11-20 12:25:26+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16298v1,1503

To achieve continuous updates of the 3D scene representation, we process the image flow with a sliding window, aligning submaps, thereby overcoming VGGT's high memory demands. We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment.

The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training.

In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.","['Erwan Dereure', 'Robin Louiset', 'Laura Parkkinen', 'David A Menassa', 'David Holcman']",2025-11-20 11:51:05+00:00,eess.IV,2511.16268v1,1159
Mem-MLP: Real-Time 3D Human Motion Generation from Sparse Inputs,"Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.","['Sinan Mutlu', 'Georgios F.

How Robot Dogs See the Unseeable,"Peering, a side-to-side motion used by animals to estimate distance through motion parallax, offers a powerful bio-inspired strategy to overcome a fundamental limitation in robotic vision: partial occlusion. Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.","['Oliver Bimber', 'Karl Dietrich von Ellenrieder', 'Michael Haller', 'Rakesh John Amala Arokia Nathan', 'Gianni Lunardi', 'Marco Camurri', 'Mohamed Youssef', 'Santos Miguel Orozco Soto', 'Jeremy E.

SwiTrack: Tri-State Switch for Cross-Modal Object Tracking,"Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Can MLLMs Read the Room? A Multimodal Benchmark for Assessing Deception in Multi-Party Social Interactions,"Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.","['Caixin Kang', 'Yifei Huang', 'Liangyang Ouyang', 'Mingfang Zhang', 'Ruicong Liu', 'Yoichi Sato']",2025-11-20 10:44:21+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16221v1,1334
Unsupervised Image Classification with Adaptive Nearest Neighbor Selection and Cluster Ensembles,"Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, ""Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles"" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.","['Melih Baydar', 'Emre Akbas']",2025-11-20 10:34:56+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16213v1,1327
When Alignment Fails: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models,"Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.","['Yuping Yan', 'Yuhan Xie', 'Yinxin Zhang', 'Lingjuan Lyu', 'Yaochu Jin']",2025-11-20 10:14:32+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16203v1,1431
PrIntMesh: Precise Intersection Surfaces for 3D Organ Mesh Reconstruction,"Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.","['Deniz Sayin Mercadier', 'Hieu Le', 'Yihong Chen', 'Jiancheng Yang', 'Udaranga Wickramasinghe', 'Pascal Fua']",2025-11-20 09:50:56+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16186v1,951
Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification,"Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.","['Nianchang Huang', 'Yi Xu', 'Ruida Xi', 'Ruida Xi', 'Qiang Zhang']",2025-11-20 09:45:37+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16184v1,1683
FOOTPASS: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Tactical Context Dataset for Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Broadcast Videos,"Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.","['Jeremie Ochin', 'Raphael Chekroun', 'Bogdan Stanciulescu', 'Sotiris Manitsaris']",2025-11-20 09:42:28+00:00,cs.AI,2511.16183v1,1441
Mantis: A Versatile Vision-Language-Action Model with Disentangled Visual Foresight,"Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.","['Yi Yang', 'Xueqi Li', 'Yiyang Chen', 'Jin Song', 'Yihan Wang', 'Zipeng Xiao', 'Jiadi Su', 'You Qiaoben', 'Pengfei Liu', 'Zhijie Deng']",2025-11-20 09:30:23+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16175v1,1750
Target Refocusing via Attention Redistribution for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation: An Explainability Perspective,"Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.","['Jiahao Li', 'Yang Lu', 'Yachao Zhang', 'Yong Xie', 'Fangyong Wang', 'Yuan Xie', 'Yanyun Qu']",2025-11-20 09:16:33+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16170v1,1241
EvoVLA: Self-Evolving Vision-Language-Action Model,"Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

An Image Is Worth Ten Thousand Words: Verbose-Text Induction Attacks on VLMs,"With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.","['Zhi Luo', 'Zenghui Yuan', 'Wenqi Wei', 'Daizong Liu', 'Pan Zhou']",2025-11-20 09:03:43+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16163v1,1716
Layer-wise Noise Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation,"Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.","['Yuting Lu', 'Ziliang Wang', 'Weixin Xu', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yongqiang Zhao', 'Yang Yu', 'Xiaohong Zhang']",2025-11-20 09:03:32+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16162v1,1655
Simba: Towards High-Fidelity and Geometrically-Consistent Point Cloud Completion via Transformation Diffusion,"Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling.

Video2Layout: Recall and Reconstruct Metric-Grounded Cognitive Map for Spatial Reasoning,"Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation for Diffusion Transformers,"Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Reasoning Guided Embeddings: Leveraging MLLM Reasoning for Improved Multimodal Retrieval,"Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.","['Chunxu Liu', 'Jiyuan Yang', 'Ruopeng Gao', 'Yuhan Zhu', 'Feng Zhu', 'Rui Zhao', 'Limin Wang']",2025-11-20 08:44:47+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16150v1,1301
LEGO-SLAM: Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM,"Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.","['Sibaek Lee', 'Seongbo Ha', 'Kyeongsu Kang', 'Joonyeol Choi', 'Seungjun Tak', 'Hyeonwoo Yu']",2025-11-20 08:31:34+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16144v1,1542
A Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception Attention for Remote Sensing Water Body Change Detection,"Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP.

Real-Time 3D Object Detection with Inference-Aligned Learning,"Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.","['Chenyu Zhao', 'Xianwei Zheng', 'Zimin Xia', 'Linwei Yue', 'Nan Xue']",2025-11-20 08:27:00+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16140v1,1233
Degradation-Aware Hierarchical Termination for Blind Quality Enhancement of Compressed Video,"Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.","['Li Yu', 'Yingbo Zhao', 'Shiyu Wu', 'Siyue Yu', 'Moncef Gabbouj', 'Qingshan Liu']",2025-11-20 08:19:41+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16137v1,1696
How Noise Benefits AI-generated Image Detection,"The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.","['Jiazhen Yan', 'Ziqiang Li', 'Fan Wang', 'Kai Zeng', 'Zhangjie Fu']",2025-11-20 08:16:24+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16136v1,1329
VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation,"Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI.

Decoupling Complexity from Scale in Latent Diffusion Model,"Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.","['Tianxiong Zhong', 'Xingye Tian', 'Xuebo Wang', 'Boyuan Jiang', 'Xin Tao', 'Pengfei Wan']",2025-11-20 07:20:33+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16117v1,1093
Clustered Error Correction with Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting,"Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

T2T-VICL: Unlocking the Boundaries of Cross-Task Visual In-Context Learning via Implicit Text-Driven VLMs,"In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.","['Shao-Jun Xia', 'Huixin Zhang', 'Zhengzhong Tu']",2025-11-20 07:02:06+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16107v1,1129
Rad-GS: Radar-Vision Integration for 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM in Outdoor Environments,"We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.","['Renxiang Xiao', 'Wei Liu', 'Yuanfan Zhang', 'Yushuai Chen', 'Jinming Chen', 'Zilu Wang', 'Liang Hu']",2025-11-20 06:32:46+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16091v1,1155
SpectralTrain: A Universal Framework for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

VideoSeg-R1:Reasoning Video Object Segmentation via Reinforcement Learning,"Traditional video reasoning segmentation methods rely on supervised fine-tuning, which limits generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios and lacks explicit reasoning. To address this, we propose \textbf{VideoSeg-R1}, the first framework to introduce reinforcement learning into video reasoning segmentation. It adopts a decoupled architecture that formulates the task as joint referring image segmentation and video mask propagation. It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem. A task difficulty-aware mechanism adaptively controls reasoning length for better efficiency and accuracy.

LiSTAR: Ray-Centric World Models for 4D LiDAR Sequences in Autonomous Driving,"Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations.

AMS-KV: Adaptive KV Caching in Multi-Scale Visual Autoregressive Transformers,"Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.","['Boxun Xu', 'Yu Wang', 'Zihu Wang', 'Peng Li']",2025-11-20 05:10:12+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16047v1,1633
LLMs-based Augmentation for Domain Adaptation in Long-tailed Food Datasets,"Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.","['Qing Wang', 'Chong-Wah Ngo', 'Ee-Peng Lim', 'Qianru Sun']",2025-11-20 04:38:56+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16037v1,1099
Crossmodal learning for Crop Canopy Trait Estimation,"Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.","['Timilehin T.

CuriGS: Curriculum-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Sparse View Synthesis,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Towards a Safer and Sustainable Manufacturing Process: Material classification in Laser Cutting Using Deep Learning,"Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643.

Mixture of Ranks with Degradation-Aware Routing for One-Step Real-World Image Super-Resolution,"The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation.

Physically Realistic Sequence-Level Adversarial Clothing for Robust Human-Detection Evasion,"Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.","['Dingkun Zhou', 'Patrick P. K.

Exploiting Inter-Sample Information for Long-tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection,"Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.","['Nimeshika Udayangani', 'Hadi M.

Thinking-while-Generating: Interleaving Textual Reasoning throughout Visual Generation,"Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation.

Nemotron Elastic: Towards Efficient Many-in-One Reasoning LLMs,"Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.","['Ali Taghibakhshi', 'Sharath Turuvekere Sreenivas', 'Saurav Muralidharan', 'Ruisi Cai', 'Marcin Chochowski', 'Ameya Sunil Mahabaleshwarkar', 'Yoshi Suhara', 'Oluwatobi Olabiyi', 'Daniel Korzekwa', 'Mostofa Patwary', 'Mohammad Shoeybi', 'Jan Kautz', 'Bryan Catanzaro', 'Ashwath Aithal', 'Nima Tajbakhsh', 'Pavlo Molchanov']",2025-11-20 18:59:21+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16664v1,1835
Comparison of Text-Based and Image-Based Retrieval in Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Large Language Model Systems,"Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.","['Elias Lumer', 'Alex Cardenas', 'Matt Melich', 'Myles Mason', 'Sara Dieter', 'Vamse Kumar Subbiah', 'Pradeep Honaganahalli Basavaraju', 'Roberto Hernandez']",2025-11-20 18:56:49+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16654v1,1838
Codec2Vec: Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning Using Neural Speech Codecs,"Recent advancements in neural audio codecs have not only enabled superior audio compression but also enhanced speech synthesis techniques. Researchers are now exploring their potential as universal acoustic feature extractors for a broader range of speech processing tasks. Building on this trend, we introduce Codec2Vec, the first speech representation learning framework that relies exclusively on discrete audio codec units. This approach offers several advantages, including improved data storage and transmission efficiency, faster training, and enhanced data privacy. We explore masked prediction with various training target derivation strategies to thoroughly understand the effectiveness of this framework.

SurvAgent: Hierarchical CoT-Enhanced Case Banking and Dichotomy-Based Multi-Agent System for Multimodal Survival Prediction,"Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.","['Guolin Huang', 'Wenting Chen', 'Jiaqi Yang', 'Xinheng Lyu', 'Xiaoling Luo', 'Sen Yang', 'Xiaohan Xing', 'Linlin Shen']",2025-11-20 18:41:44+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16635v1,1435
TimeViper: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision-Language Model for Efficient Long Video Understanding,"We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.","['Boshen Xu', 'Zihan Xiao', 'Jiaze Li', 'Jianzhong Ju', 'Zhenbo Luo', 'Jian Luan', 'Qin Jin']",2025-11-20 17:48:21+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16595v1,1353
D-GARA: A Dynamic Benchmarking Framework for GUI Agent Robustness in Real-World Anomalies,"Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.","['Sen Chen', 'Tong Zhao', 'Yi Bin', 'Fei Ma', 'Wenqi Shao', 'Zheng Wang']",2025-11-20 17:43:46+00:00,cs.AI,2511.16590v1,1314
Integrating Symbolic Natural Language Understanding and Language Models for Word Sense Disambiguation,"Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.","['Kexin Zhao', 'Ken Forbus']",2025-11-20 17:32:15+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16577v1,953
WER is Unaware: Assessing How ASR Errors Distort Clinical Understanding in Patient Facing Dialogue,"As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.","['Zachary Ellis', 'Jared Joselowitz', 'Yash Deo', 'Yajie He', 'Anna Kalygina', 'Aisling Higham', 'Mana Rahimzadeh', 'Yan Jia', 'Ibrahim Habli', 'Ernest Lim']",2025-11-20 16:59:20+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16544v1,1163
The Oracle and The Prism: A Decoupled and Efficient Framework for Generative Recommendation Explanation,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage.
  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.
  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.","['Jiaheng Zhang', 'Daqiang Zhang']",2025-11-20 16:59:16+00:00,cs.IR,2511.16543v1,1350
Beyond Tokens in Language Models: Interpreting Activations through Text Genre Chunks,"Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.","['Éloïse Benito-Rodriguez', 'Einar Urdshals', 'Jasmina Nasufi', 'Nicky Pochinkov']",2025-11-20 16:53:12+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16540v1,714
TurkColBERT: A Benchmark of Dense and Late-Interaction Models for Turkish Information Retrieval,"Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.","['Özay Ezerceli', 'Mahmoud El Hussieni', 'Selva Taş', 'Reyhan Bayraktar', 'Fatma Betül Terzioğlu', 'Yusuf Çelebi', 'Yağız Asker']",2025-11-20 16:42:21+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16528v1,1698

"Music Recommendation with Large Language Models: Challenges, Opportunities, and Evaluation","Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators.
  This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music. We then examine evaluation practices from NLP, highlighting methodologies and open challenges relevant to MRS. Finally, we synthesize insights-focusing on how LLM prompting applies to MRS, to outline a structured set of success and risk dimensions. Our goal is to provide the MRS community with an updated, pedagogical, and cross-disciplinary perspective on evaluation.","['Elena V.

We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness.

TOFA: Training-Free One-Shot Federated Adaptation for Vision-Language Models,"Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.","['Li Zhang', 'Zhongxuan Han', 'XiaoHua Feng', 'Jiaming Zhang', 'Yuyuan Li', 'Linbo Jiang', 'Jianan Lin', 'Chaochao Chen']",2025-11-20 14:45:59+00:00,cs.AI,2511.16423v1,1917
"Classification of worldwide news articles by perceived quality, 2018-2024","This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC.

"AICC: Parse HTML Finer, Make Models Better -- A 7.3T AI-Ready Corpus Built by a Model-Based HTML Parser","While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.","['Ren Ma', 'Jiantao Qiu', 'Chao Xu', 'Pei Chu', 'Kaiwen Liu', 'Pengli Ren', 'Yuan Qu', 'Jiahui Peng', 'Linfeng Hou', 'Mengjie Liu', 'Lindong Lu', 'Wenchang Ning', 'Jia Yu', 'Rui Min', 'Jin Shi', 'Haojiong Chen', 'Peng Zhang', 'Wenjian Zhang', 'Qian Jiang', 'Zengjie Hu', 'Guoqiang Yang', 'Zhenxiang Li', 'Fukai Shang', 'Zhongying Tu', 'Wentao Zhang', 'Dahua Lin', 'Conghui He']",2025-11-20 14:15:23+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16397v1,1915
Learning from Sufficient Rationales: Analysing the Relationship Between Explanation Faithfulness and Token-level Regularisation Strategies,"Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.","['Jonathan Kamp', 'Lisa Beinborn', 'Antske Fokkens']",2025-11-20 13:39:20+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16353v1,1298
NLP Datasets for Idiom and Figurative Language Tasks,"Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks.

OpenMMReasoner: Pushing the Frontiers for Multimodal Reasoning with an Open and General Recipe,"Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

Incorporating Self-Rewriting into Large Language Model Reasoning Reinforcement,"Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only ""simple"" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.","['Jiashu Yao', 'Heyan Huang', 'Shuang Zeng', 'Chuwei Luo', 'WangJie You', 'Jie Tang', 'Qingsong Liu', 'Yuhang Guo', 'Yangyang Kang']",2025-11-20 13:10:52+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16331v1,1725
SDA: Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment for Open LLMs without Fine-Tuning,"With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H).

However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.","['Xingtao Zhao', 'Hao Peng', 'Dingli Su', 'Xianghua Zeng', 'Chunyang Liu', 'Jinzhi Liao', 'Philip S.

Can MLLMs Read the Room? A Multimodal Benchmark for Assessing Deception in Multi-Party Social Interactions,"Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.","['Caixin Kang', 'Yifei Huang', 'Liangyang Ouyang', 'Mingfang Zhang', 'Ruicong Liu', 'Yoichi Sato']",2025-11-20 10:44:21+00:00,cs.CV,2511.16221v1,1334
PSM: Prompt Sensitivity Minimization via LLM-Guided Black-Box Optimization,"System prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they often contain proprietary logic or sensitive information, making them a prime target for extraction attacks. Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

SemanticCite: Citation Verification with AI-Powered Full-Text Analysis and Evidence-Based Reasoning,"Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.",['Sebastian Haan'],2025-11-20 10:05:21+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16198v1,1749
TS-PEFT: Token-Selective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Learnable Threshold Gating,"In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.","['Dabiao Ma', 'Ziming Dai', 'Zhimin Xin', 'Shu Wang', 'Ye Wang', 'Haojun Fei']",2025-11-20 08:41:20+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16147v1,977
ELPO: Ensemble Learning Based Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models,"The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.","['Qing Zhang', 'Bing Xu', 'Xudong Zhang', 'Yifan Shi', 'Yang Li', 'Chen Zhang', 'Yik Chung Wu', 'Ngai Wong', 'Yijie Chen', 'Hong Dai', 'Xiansen Chen', 'Mian Zhang']",2025-11-20 07:27:26+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16122v1,1329
Early science acceleration experiments with GPT-5,"AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science. In these examples, the authors highlight how AI accelerated their work, and where it fell short; where expert time was saved, and where human input was still key. We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.","['Sébastien Bubeck', 'Christian Coester', 'Ronen Eldan', 'Timothy Gowers', 'Yin Tat Lee', 'Alexandru Lupsasca', 'Mehtaab Sawhney', 'Robert Scherrer', 'Mark Sellke', 'Brian K.

Learning Tractable Distributions Of Language Model Continuations,"Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.","['Gwen Yidou-Weng', 'Ian Li', 'Anji Liu', 'Oliver Broadrick', 'Guy Van den Broeck', 'Benjie Wang']",2025-11-20 05:17:19+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16054v1,1740
Liars' Bench: Evaluating Lie Detectors for Language Models,"Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.","['Kieron Kretschmar', 'Walter Laurito', 'Sharan Maiya', 'Samuel Marks']",2025-11-20 04:29:33+00:00,cs.CL,2511.16035v1,1002

QueryGym: A Toolkit for Reproducible LLM-Based Query Reformulation,"We present QueryGym, a lightweight, extensible Python toolkit that supports large language model (LLM)-based query reformulation. This is an important tool development since recent work on llm-based query reformulation has shown notable increase in retrieval effectiveness. However, while different authors have sporadically shared the implementation of their methods, there is no unified toolkit that provides a consistent implementation of such methods, which hinders fair comparison, rapid experimentation, consistent benchmarking and reliable deployment. QueryGym addresses this gap by providing a unified framework for implementing, executing, and comparing llm-based reformulation methods. The toolkit offers: (1) a Python API for applying diverse LLM-based methods, (2) a retrieval-agnostic interface supporting integration with backends such as Pyserini and PyTerrier, (3) a centralized prompt management system with versioning and metadata tracking, (4) built-in support for benchmarks like BEIR and MS MARCO, and (5) a completely open-source extensible implementation available to all researchers.

We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning.

TOD-ProcBench: Benchmarking Complex Instruction-Following in Task-Oriented Dialogues,"In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.","['Sarik Ghazarian', 'Abhinav Gullapalli', 'Swair Shah', 'Anurag Beniwal', 'Nanyun Peng', 'Narayanan Sadagopan', 'Zhou Yu']",2025-11-20 02:10:30+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15976v1,1920
JudgeBoard: Benchmarking and Enhancing Small Language Models for Reasoning Evaluation,"While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.","['Zhenyu Bi', 'Gaurav Srivastava', 'Yang Li', 'Meng Lu', 'Swastik Roy', 'Morteza Ziyadi', 'Xuan Wang']",2025-11-20 01:14:39+00:00,cs.AI,2511.15958v1,1852

Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations.

What Really Counts? Examining Step and Token Level Attribution in Multilingual CoT Reasoning,"This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.","['Jeremias Ferrao', 'Ezgi Basar', 'Khondoker Ittehadul Islam', 'Mahrokh Hassani']",2025-11-19 21:23:58+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15886v1,1076
The Subtle Art of Defection: Understanding Uncooperative Behaviors in LLM based Multi-Agent Systems,"This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and analyzing how uncooperative behaviors can destabilize or collapse LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.","['Devang Kulshreshtha', 'Wanyu Du', 'Raghav Jain', 'Srikanth Doss', 'Hang Su', 'Sandesh Swamy', 'Yanjun Qi']",2025-11-19 20:39:19+00:00,cs.MA,2511.15862v1,1169
Step-Audio-R1 Technical Report,"Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence.

Tokenisation over Bounded Alphabets is Hard,"Recent works have shown that tokenisation is NP-complete. However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: bottom-up tokenisation and direct tokenisation, where we must, respectively, select a sequence of merge operations or a vocabulary whose application optimally compresses a dataset. First, we note that proving hardness results for an $n$-ary alphabet proves the same results for alphabets of any larger size. We then prove that even with binary alphabets, both variants are not only NP-complete, but admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P=NP). We further show that direct tokenisation remains NP-complete even when applied to unary alphabets. While unary alphabets may not be practically useful, this result establishes that the computational intractability of tokenisation is not an artifact of large alphabets or complex constructions, but a fundamental barrier. Overall, our results explain why practical algorithms such as BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points toward approximation algorithms being an important path going forward for tokenisation research.","['Violeta Kastreva', 'Philip Whittington', 'Dennis Komm', 'Tiago Pimentel']",2025-11-19 18:59:56+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15709v1,1382
"Think Visually, Reason Textually: Vision-Language Synergy in ARC","Abstract reasoning from minimal examples remains a core unsolved problem for frontier foundation models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4. These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models.

MoDES: Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Expert Skipping,"Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks, but they suffer from high computational inefficiency. To reduce inference overhead, expert skipping methods have been proposed to deactivate redundant experts based on the current input tokens. However, we find that applying these methods-originally designed for unimodal large language models (LLMs)-to MLLMs results in considerable performance degradation. This is primarily because such methods fail to account for the heterogeneous contributions of experts across MoE layers and modality-specific behaviors of tokens within these layers. Motivated by these findings, we propose MoDES, the first training-free framework that adaptively skips experts to enable efficient and accurate MoE MLLM inference. It incorporates a globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) mechanism that integrates global layer-wise importance into local routing probabilities to accurately estimate per-token expert importance. A dual-modality thresholding (DMT) method is then applied, which processes tokens from each modality separately, to derive the skipping schedule. To set the optimal thresholds, we introduce a frontier search algorithm that exploits monotonicity properties, cutting convergence time from several days to a few hours. Extensive experiments for 3 model series across 13 benchmarks demonstrate that MoDES far outperforms previous approaches. For instance, when skipping 88% experts for Qwen3-VL-MoE-30B-A3B-Instruct, the performance boost is up to 10.67% (97.33% vs. 86.66%). Furthermore, MoDES significantly enhances inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 2.16$\times$ and the decoding time by 1.26$\times$.","['Yushi Huang', 'Zining Wang', 'Zhihang Yuan', 'Yifu Ding', 'Ruihao Gong', 'Jinyang Guo', 'Xianglong Liu', 'Jun Zhang']",2025-11-19 18:48:27+00:00,cs.CV,2511.15690v1,1716

However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

When to Think and When to Look: Uncertainty-Guided Lookback,"Test-time thinking (that is, generating explicit intermediate reasoning chains) is known to boost performance in large language models and has recently shown strong gains for large vision language models (LVLMs). However, despite these promising results, there is still no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning. We provide the first such analysis with a large scale, controlled comparison of thinking for LVLMs, evaluating ten variants from the InternVL3.5 and Qwen3-VL families on MMMU-val under generous token budgets and multi pass decoding. We show that more thinking is not always better; long chains often yield long wrong trajectories that ignore the image and underperform the same models run in standard instruct mode. A deeper analysis reveals that certain short lookback phrases, which explicitly refer back to the image, are strongly enriched in successful trajectories and correlate with better visual grounding. Building on this insight, we propose uncertainty guided lookback, a training free decoding strategy that combines an uncertainty signal with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search. Our method improves overall MMMU performance, delivers the largest gains in categories where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms several strong decoding baselines, setting a new state of the art under fixed model families and token budgets. We further show that this decoding strategy generalizes, yielding consistent improvements on five additional benchmarks, including two broad multimodal suites and math focused visual reasoning datasets.","['Jing Bi', 'Filippos Bellos', 'Junjia Guo', 'Yayuan Li', 'Chao Huang', 'Yunlong', 'Tang', 'Luchuan Song', 'Susan Liang', 'Zhongfei', 'Zhang', 'Jason J.

SRPO: Self-Referential Policy Optimization for Vision-Language-Action Models,"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.","['Senyu Fei', 'Siyin Wang', 'Li Ji', 'Ao Li', 'Shiduo Zhang', 'Liming Liu', 'Jinlong Hou', 'Jingjing Gong', 'Xianzhong Zhao', 'Xipeng Qiu']",2025-11-19 16:52:23+00:00,cs.RO,2511.15605v1,1707
HSKBenchmark: Modeling and Benchmarking Chinese Second Language Acquisition in Large Language Models through Curriculum Tuning,"Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

Computer-Use Agents as Judges for Generative User Interface,"Computer-Use Agents (CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Yet, most GUI remain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-oriented language models (Coder) have transformed automatic GUI design. This raises a fundamental question: Can CUA as judges to assist Coder for automatic GUI design? To investigate, we introduce AUI-Gym, a benchmark for Automatic GUI development spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Using language models, we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensure task reliability, we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose a Coder-CUA in Collaboration framework: the Coder acts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while the CUA serves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but by task solvability and CUA navigation success rate. To turn CUA feedback into usable guidance, we design a CUA Dashboard that compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretable guidance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments.

Multimodal Evaluation of Russian-language Architectures,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.","['Artem Chervyakov', 'Ulyana Isaeva', 'Anton Emelyanov', 'Artem Safin', 'Maria Tikhonova', 'Alexander Kharitonov', 'Yulia Lyakh', 'Petr Surovtsev', 'Denis Shevelev', 'Vildan Saburov', 'Vasily Konovalov', 'Elisei Rykov', 'Ivan Sviridov', 'Amina Miftakhova', 'Ilseyar Alimova', 'Alexander Panchenko', 'Alexander Kapitanov', 'Alena Fenogenova']",2025-11-19 15:43:53+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15552v2,1329
Standardising the NLP Workflow: A Framework for Reproducible Linguistic Analysis,"The introduction of large language models and other influential developments in AI-based language processing have led to an evolution in the methods available to quantitatively analyse language data. With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations. LPDS and pelican nlp collectively offer an end-to-end processing pipeline for linguistic data, designed to ensure methodological transparency and enhance reproducibility.","['Yves Pauli', 'Jan-Bernard Marsman', 'Finn Rabe', 'Victoria Edkins', 'Roya Hüppi', 'Silvia Ciampelli', 'Akhil Ratan Misra', 'Nils Lang', 'Wolfram Hinzen', 'Iris Sommer', 'Philipp Homan']",2025-11-19 15:06:08+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15512v1,1599
CroPS: Improving Dense Retrieval with Cross-Perspective Positive Samples in Short-Video Search,"Dense retrieval has become a foundational paradigm in modern search systems, especially on short-video platforms. However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. CroPS is now fully deployed in Kuaishou Search, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.","['Ao Xie', 'Jiahui Chen', 'Quanzhi Zhu', 'Xiaoze Jiang', 'Zhiheng Qin', 'Enyun Yu', 'Han Li']",2025-11-19 13:57:40+00:00,cs.IR,2511.15443v1,1541
LLM-MemCluster: Empowering Large Language Models with Dynamic Memory for Text Clustering,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping unsupervised learning by offering an unprecedented ability to perform text clustering based on their deep semantic understanding. However, their direct application is fundamentally limited by a lack of stateful memory for iterative refinement and the difficulty of managing cluster granularity. As a result, existing methods often rely on complex pipelines with external modules, sacrificing a truly end-to-end approach. We introduce LLM-MemCluster, a novel framework that reconceptualizes clustering as a fully LLM-native task. It leverages a Dynamic Memory to instill state awareness and a Dual-Prompt Strategy to enable the model to reason about and determine the number of clusters. Evaluated on several benchmark datasets, our tuning-free framework significantly and consistently outperforms strong baselines. LLM-MemCluster presents an effective, interpretable, and truly end-to-end paradigm for LLM-based text clustering.","['Yuanjie Zhu', 'Liangwei Yang', 'Ke Xu', 'Weizhi Zhang', 'Zihe Song', 'Jindong Wang', 'Philip S.

Building Robust and Scalable Multilingual ASR for Indian Languages,"This paper describes the systems developed by SPRING Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, for the ASRU MADASR 2.0 challenge. The systems developed focuses on adapting ASR systems to improve in predicting the language and dialect of the utterance among 8 languages across 33 dialects. We participated in Track 1 and Track 2, which restricts the use of additional data and develop from-the-scratch multilingual systems. We presented a novel training approach using Multi-Decoder architecture with phonemic Common Label Set (CLS) as intermediate representation. It improved the performance over the baseline (in the CLS space). We also discuss various methods used to retain the gain obtained in the phonemic space while converting them back to the corresponding grapheme representations. Our systems beat the baseline in 3 languages (Track 2) in terms of WER/CER and achieved the highest language ID and dialect ID accuracy among all participating teams (Track 2).","['Arjun Gangwar', 'Kaousheik Jayakumar', 'S.

NAMeGEn: Creative Name Generation via A Novel Agent-based Multiple Personalized Goal Enhancement Framework,"Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.","['Shanlin Zhou', 'Xinpeng Wang', 'Jianxun Lian', 'Zhenghao Liu', 'Laks V.

DEPO: Dual-Efficiency Preference Optimization for LLM Agents,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their reasoning and decision-making abilities when deployed as agents. Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data.

A Compliance-Preserving Retrieval System for Aircraft MRO Task Search,"Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs) spend up to 30% of work time searching manuals, a documented efficiency bottleneck in MRO operations where every procedure must be traceable to certified sources. We present a compliance-preserving retrieval system that adapts LLM reranking and semantic search to aviation MRO environments by operating alongside, rather than replacing, certified legacy viewers. The system constructs revision-robust embeddings from ATA chapter hierarchies and uses vision-language parsing to structure certified content, allowing technicians to preview ranked tasks and access verified procedures in existing viewers. Evaluation on 49k synthetic queries achieves >90% retrieval accuracy, while bilingual controlled studies with 10 licensed AMTs demonstrate 90.9% top-10 success rate and 95% reduction in lookup time, from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds per task.

HEAD-QA v2: Expanding a Healthcare Benchmark for Reasoning,"We introduce HEAD-QA v2, an expanded and updated version of a Spanish/English healthcare multiple-choice reasoning dataset originally released by Vilares and Gómez-Rodríguez (2019).

We extend the dataset to over 12,000 questions from ten years of Spanish professional exams, benchmark several open-source LLMs using prompting, RAG, and probability-based answer selection, and provide additional multilingual versions to support future work. Results indicate that performance is mainly driven by model scale and intrinsic reasoning ability, with complex inference strategies obtaining limited gains.

SkyEgg: Joint Implementation Selection and Scheduling for Hardware Synthesis using E-graphs,"Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices.
  We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.","['Youwei Xiao', 'Yuyang Zou', 'Yun Liang']",2025-11-19 10:39:45+00:00,cs.PL,2511.15323v1,1760
Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,"We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for Large Language Models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.","['Piercosma Bisconti', 'Matteo Prandi', 'Federico Pierucci', 'Francesco Giarrusso', 'Marcantonio Bracale', 'Marcello Galisai', 'Vincenzo Suriani', 'Olga Sorokoletova', 'Federico Sartore', 'Daniele Nardi']",2025-11-19 10:14:08+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15304v2,1266

ChartEditor: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust Chart Editing,"Chart editing reduces manual effort in visualization design. Typical benchmarks limited in data diversity and assume access to complete chart code, which is seldom in real-world scenarios.

It encompasses diverse editing instructions and covers nearly all editable chart elements. The inputs in ChartEditVista include only the original chart image and natural language editing instructions, without the original chart codes. ChartEditVista is generated through a fully automated pipeline that produces, edits, and verifies charts, ensuring high-quality chart editing data. Besides, we introduce two novel fine-grained, rule-based evaluation metrics: the layout metric, which evaluates the position, size and color of graphical components; and the text metric, which jointly assesses textual content and font styling. Building on top of ChartEditVista, we present ChartEditor, a model trained using a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a novel rendering reward to simultaneously enforce code executability and visual fidelity.

"M, Toolchain and Language for Reusable Model Compilation","Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.","['Hiep Hong Trinh', 'Federico Ciccozzi', 'Abu Naser Masud', 'Marjan Sirjani', 'Mikael Sjödin']",2025-11-19 09:21:46+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15257v1,1840
Context Cascade Compression: Exploring the Upper Limits of Text Compression,"Million-level token inputs in long-context tasks pose significant computational and memory challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

OEMA: Ontology-Enhanced Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Zero-Shot Clinical Named Entity Recognition,"With the rapid expansion of unstructured clinical texts in electronic health records (EHRs), clinical named entity recognition (NER) has become a crucial technique for extracting medical information. However, traditional supervised models such as CRF and BioClinicalBERT suffer from high annotation costs. Although zero-shot NER based on large language models (LLMs) reduces the dependency on labeled data, challenges remain in aligning example selection with task granularity and effectively integrating prompt design with self-improvement frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose OEMA, a novel zero-shot clinical NER framework based on multi-agent collaboration. OEMA consists of three core components: (1) a self-annotator that autonomously generates candidate examples; (2) a discriminator that leverages SNOMED CT to filter token-level examples by clinical relevance; and (3) a predictor that incorporates entity-type descriptions to enhance inference accuracy. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, MTSamples and VAERS, demonstrate that OEMA achieves state-of-the-art performance under exact-match evaluation. Moreover, under related-match criteria, OEMA performs comparably to the supervised BioClinicalBERT model while significantly outperforming the traditional CRF method. OEMA improves zero-shot clinical NER, achieving near-supervised performance under related-match criteria. Future work will focus on continual learning and open-domain adaptation to expand its applicability in clinical NLP.","['Xinli Tao', 'Xin Dong', 'Xuezhong Zhou']",2025-11-19 08:02:55+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15211v2,1527
Unveiling Intrinsic Dimension of Texts: from Academic Abstract to Creative Story,"Intrinsic dimension (ID) is an important tool in modern LLM analysis, informing studies of training dynamics, scaling behavior, and dataset structure, yet its textual determinants remain underexplored. We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text ""representationally simple"" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively ""easy"", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.","['Vladislav Pedashenko', 'Laida Kushnareva', 'Yana Khassan Nibal', 'Eduard Tulchinskii', 'Kristian Kuznetsov', 'Vladislav Zharchinskii', 'Yury Maximov', 'Irina Piontkovskaya']",2025-11-19 08:00:40+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15210v1,1468
HinTel-AlignBench: A Framework and Benchmark for Hindi-Telugu with English-Aligned Samples,"With nearly 1.5 billion people and more than 120 major languages, India represents one of the most diverse regions in the world. As multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, robust evaluation methodologies are essential to drive progress toward equitable AI for low-resource languages. Current multilingual VLM evaluations suffer from four major limitations: reliance on unverified auto-translations, narrow task/domain coverage, limited sample sizes, and lack of cultural and natively sourced Question-Answering (QA). To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu. We categorize common failure modes to highlight concrete areas of improvement in multilingual multimodal understanding.","['Rishikant Chigrupaatii', 'Ponnada Sai Tulasi Kanishka', 'Lalit Chandra Routhu', 'Martin Patel Sama Supratheek Reddy', 'Divyam Gupta', 'Dasari Srikar', 'Krishna Teja Kuchimanchi', 'Rajiv Misra', 'Rohun Tripathi']",2025-11-19 07:11:00+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15183v1,1670
"Teaching According to Students' Aptitude: Personalized Mathematics Tutoring via Persona-, Memory-, and Forgetting-Aware LLMs","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into intelligent tutoring systems to provide human-like and adaptive instruction. However, most existing approaches fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across their proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns. This challenge is particularly acute in mathematics tutoring, where effective instruction requires fine-grained scaffolding precisely calibrated to each student's mastery level and cognitive retention. To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.","['Yang Wu', 'Rujing Yao', 'Tong Zhang', 'Yufei Shi', 'Zhuoren Jiang', 'Zhushan Li', 'Xiaozhong Liu']",2025-11-19 06:28:16+00:00,cs.CL,2511.15163v1,1343
Generating Natural-Language Surgical Feedback: From Structured Representation to Domain-Grounded Evaluation,"High-quality intraoperative feedback from a surgical trainer is pivotal for improving trainee performance and long-term skill acquisition. Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.","['Firdavs Nasriddinov', 'Rafal Kocielnik', 'Anima Anandkumar', 'Andrew J.

CASTELLA: Long Audio Dataset with Captions and Temporal Boundaries,"We introduce CASTELLA, a human-annotated audio benchmark for the task of audio moment retrieval (AMR). Although AMR has various useful potential applications, there is still no established benchmark with real-world data. The early study of AMR trained the model with solely synthetic datasets. Moreover, the evaluation is based on annotated dataset of fewer than 100 samples. This resulted in less reliable reported performance. To ensure performance for applications in real-world environments, we present CASTELLA, a large-scale manually annotated AMR dataset. CASTELLA consists of 1,009, 213, and 640 audio recordings for train, valid, and test split, respectively, which is 24 times larger than the previous dataset. We also establish a baseline model for AMR using CASTELLA. Our experiments demonstrate that a model fine-tuned on CASTELLA after pre-training on the synthetic data outperformed a model trained solely on the synthetic data by 10.4 points in Recall1@0.7.

Knowledge-Informed Automatic Feature Extraction via Collaborative Large Language Model Agents,"The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a ""flooding-pruning"" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.","['Henrik Bradland', 'Morten Goodwin', 'Vladimir I.

Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Vertically Written Japanese Text,"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen rapid advances in recent years and are now being applied to visual document understanding tasks. They are expected to process a wide range of document images across languages, including Japanese. Understanding documents from images requires models to read what are written in them. Since some Japanese documents are written vertically, support for vertical writing is essential. However, research specifically focused on vertically written Japanese text remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the reading capability of existing MLLMs on vertically written Japanese text. First, we generate a synthetic Japanese OCR dataset by rendering Japanese texts into images, and use it for both model fine-tuning and evaluation. This dataset includes Japanese text in both horizontal and vertical writing. We also create an evaluation dataset sourced from the real-world document images containing vertically written Japanese text. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that the existing MLLMs perform worse on vertically written Japanese text than on horizontally written Japanese text. Furthermore, we show that training MLLMs on our synthesized Japanese OCR dataset results in improving the performance of models that previously could not handle vertical writing. The datasets and code are publicly available https://github.com/llm-jp/eval_vertical_ja.","['Keito Sasagawa', 'Shuhei Kurita', 'Daisuke Kawahara']",2025-11-19 03:04:22+00:00,cs.CV,2511.15059v1,1399

Drawing on probabilistic modeling, information theory, trigonometric signal analysis, and Bayesian uncertainty estimation, we analyze how errors compound autoregressively, propose refined uncertainty metrics, including semantic and phase-aware variants, and develop principled mitigation strategies such as contrastive decoding, retrieval-augmented grounding, factual alignment, and abstention.

How to Train Private Clinical Language Models: A Comparative Study of Privacy-Preserving Pipelines for ICD-9 Coding,"Large language models trained on clinical text risk exposing sensitive patient information, yet differential privacy (DP) methods often severely degrade the diagnostic accuracy needed for deployment. Despite rapid progress in DP optimisation and text generation, it remains unclear which privacy-preserving strategy actually works best for clinical language tasks. We present the first systematic head-to-head comparison of four training pipelines for automated diagnostic coding from hospital discharge summaries. All pipelines use identical 1B-parameter models and matched privacy budgets to predict ICD-9 codes. At moderate and relaxed privacy budgets ($\varepsilon \in \{4, 6\}$), knowledge distillation from DP-trained teachers outperforms both direct DP-SGD and DP-synthetic data training, recovering up to 63\% of the non-private performance whilst maintaining strong empirical privacy (membership-inference AUC $\approx$ 0.5). These findings expose large differences in the privacy-utility trade-off across architectures and identify knowledge distillation as the most practical route to privacy-preserving clinical NLP.","['Mathieu Dufour', 'Andrew Duncan']",2025-11-18 21:51:04+00:00,cs.LG,2511.14936v1,1128
Skin-R1: Toward Trustworthy Clinical Reasoning for Dermatological Diagnosis,"The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.
  To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT.","['Zehao Liu', 'Wejieying Ren', 'Jipeng Zhang', 'Tianxiang Zhao', 'Jingxi Zhu', 'Xiaoting Li', 'Vasant G.

Hierarchical Token Prepending: Enhancing Information Flow in Decoder-based LLM Embeddings,"Large language models produce powerful text embeddings, but their causal attention mechanism restricts the flow of information from later to earlier tokens, degrading representation quality. While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis. HTP achieves consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings. As a simple, architecture-agnostic method, HTP enhances both zero-shot and finetuned models, offering a scalable route to superior long-document embeddings.","['Xueying Ding', 'Xingyue Huang', 'Mingxuan Ju', 'Liam Collins', 'Yozen Liu', 'Leman Akoglu', 'Neil Shah', 'Tong Zhao']",2025-11-18 19:37:40+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14868v1,1079
Empowering Multi-Turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning with Group Turn Policy Optimization,"Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) - where models iteratively reason, generate code, and verify through execution - remains challenging for existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Current RL methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from coarse-grained, trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn interactions, leading to training stagnation. To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.","['Yifeng Ding', 'Hung Le', 'Songyang Han', 'Kangrui Ruan', 'Zhenghui Jin', 'Varun Kumar', 'Zijian Wang', 'Anoop Deoras']",2025-11-18 19:01:16+00:00,cs.LG,2511.14846v1,1240

Subword Tokenization Strategies for Kurdish Word Embeddings,"We investigate tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings by comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks. We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\% of test cases compared to 68.7\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.","['Ali Salehi', 'Cassandra L.

"Talk, Snap, Complain: Validation-Aware Multimodal Expert Framework for Fine-Grained Customer Grievances","Existing approaches to complaint analysis largely rely on unimodal, short-form content such as tweets or product reviews. This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images.

This enables research questions regarding how they can be used to encode physical information that is usually only available from scientific measurements, and loosely encoded in textual descriptions. Using astrophysics as a test bed, we investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics that are obtained from scientific measurements through two main questions: 1) Does prompting play a role on how those quantities are codified by the LLM? and 2) What aspects of language are most important in encoding the physics represented by the measurement?

SMRC: Aligning Large Language Models with Student Reasoning for Mathematical Error Correction,"Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability.

Quadratic Term Correction on Heaps' Law,"Heaps' or Herdan's law characterizes the word-type vs. word-token relation by a power-law function, which is concave in linear-linear scale but a straight line in log-log scale. However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement"" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance"" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.","['Oscar Fontanelli', 'Wentian Li']",2025-11-18 17:22:00+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14683v1,1172
Streamlining Industrial Contract Management with Retrieval-Augmented LLMs,"Contract management involves reviewing and negotiating provisions, individual clauses that define rights, obligations, and terms of agreement.

In this paper, we present a modular framework designed to streamline contract management through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system integrates synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment to flag problematic revisions and generate improved alternatives. Developed and evaluated in collaboration with an industry partner, our system achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions, demonstrating strong performance under real-world, low-resource conditions and offering a practical means of accelerating contract revision workflows.","['Kristi Topollai', 'Tolga Dimlioglu', 'Anna Choromanska', 'Simon Odie', 'Reginald Hui']",2025-11-18 17:10:57+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14671v1,1062
"Bias in, Bias out: Annotation Bias in Multilingual Large Language Models","Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes.

Graded strength of comparative illusions is explained by Bayesian inference,"Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.","['Yuhan Zhang', 'Erxiao Wang', 'Cory Shain']",2025-11-18 16:33:19+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14642v1,1782

Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.","['Tao Yang', 'Dandan Huang', 'Yunting Lin', 'Pengfei Wu', 'Zhikun Wu', 'Gangyuan Ma', 'Yulan Lu', 'Xinran Dong', 'Dingpeng Li', 'Junshuang Ge', 'Zhiyan Zhang', 'Xuanzhao Huang', 'Wenyan Nong', 'Yao Zhou', 'Hui Tang', 'Hongxi Yang', 'Shijie Zhang', 'Juan Li', 'Xiaojun Cao', 'Lin Yang', 'Xia Gao', 'Kaishou Xu', 'Xiaoqiong Gu', 'Wen Zhang', 'Huimin Xia', 'Li Liu', 'Wenhao Zhou', 'Mulin Jun Li']",2025-11-18 16:29:19+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14638v1,1337
Enhancing Agentic Autonomous Scientific Discovery with Vision-Language Model Capabilities,"We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

Bridging Human and Model Perspectives: A Comparative Analysis of Political Bias Detection in News Media Using Large Language Models,"Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.","['Shreya Adrita Banik', 'Niaz Nafi Rahman', 'Tahsina Moiukh', 'Farig Sadeque']",2025-11-18 15:58:04+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14606v1,1417
A Method for Characterizing Disease Progression from Acute Kidney Injury to Chronic Kidney Disease,"Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.","['Yilu Fang', 'Jordan G.

Leveraging Digitized Newspapers to Collect Summarization Data in Low-Resource Languages,"High quality summarization data remains scarce in under-represented languages. However, historical newspapers, made available through recent digitization efforts, offer an abundant source of untapped, naturally annotated data. In this work, we present a novel method for collecting naturally occurring summaries via Front-Page Teasers, where editors summarize full length articles. We show that this phenomenon is common across seven diverse languages and supports multi-document summarization. To scale data collection, we develop an automatic process, suited to varying linguistic resource levels. Finally, we apply this process to a Hebrew newspaper title, producing HEBTEASESUM, the first dedicated multi-document summarization dataset in Hebrew.","['Noam Dahan', 'Omer Kidron', 'Gabriel Stanovsky']",2025-11-18 15:39:48+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14598v1,750
Examining the Metrics for Document-Level Claim Extraction in Czech and Slovak,"Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.","['Lucia Makaiová', 'Martin Fajčík', 'Antonín Jarolím']",2025-11-18 15:09:09+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14566v1,1320
LiveRAG: A diverse Q&A dataset with varying difficulty level for RAG evaluation,"With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.","['David Carmel', 'Simone Filice', 'Guy Horowitz', 'Yoelle Maarek', 'Alex Shtoff', 'Oren Somekh', 'Ran Tavory']",2025-11-18 14:34:35+00:00,cs.CL,2511.14531v1,1238
"[Experiment, Analysis, and Benchmark] Systematic Evaluation of Plan-based Adaptive Query Processing","Unreliable cardinality estimation remains a critical performance bottleneck in database management systems (DBMSs). Adaptive Query Processing (AQP) strategies address this limitation by providing a more robust query execution mechanism. Specifically, plan-based AQP achieves this by incrementally refining cardinality using feedback from the execution of sub-plans. However, the actual reason behind the improvements of plan-based AQP, especially across different storage architectures (on-disk vs. in-memory DBMSs), remains unexplored.
  This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art plan-based AQP. We implement and evaluate this strategy on both on-disk and in-memory DBMSs across two benchmarks. Our key findings reveal that while plan-based AQP provides overall speedups in both environments, the sources of improvement differ significantly. In the on-disk DBMS, PostgreSQL, performance gains primarily come from the query plan reorderings, but not the cardinality updating mechanism; in fact, updating cardinalities introduces measurable overhead. Conversely, in the in-memory DBMS, DuckDB, cardinality refinement drives significant performance improvements for most queries. We also observe significant performance benefits of the plan-based AQP compared to a state-of-the-art related-based AQP method. These observations provide crucial insights for researchers on when and why plan-based AQP is effective, and ultimately guide database system developers on the tradeoffs between the implementation effort and performance improvements.","['Pei Mu', 'Anderson Chaves Carniel', 'Antonio Barbalace', 'Amir Shaikhha']",2025-11-20 15:22:53+00:00,cs.DB,2511.16455v1,1570
Trustworthy AI in the Agentic Lakehouse: from Concurrency to Governance,"Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.","['Jacopo Tagliabue', 'Federico Bianchi', 'Ciro Greco']",2025-11-20 14:21:34+00:00,cs.AI,2511.16402v1,817
From Patents to Dataset: Scraping for Oxide Glass Compositions and Properties,"In this work, we present web scraping techniques to extract in- formation from patent tables, clean and structure them for future use in predictive machine learning models to develop new glasses. We extracted compositions and three properties relevant to the development of new glasses and structured them into a database to be used together with information from other available datasets. We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications. We emphasize that the compositions of the new database contain relatively more titanium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, iron, tin, and yttrium oxides than those of the existing bases.","['Gustavo Laranja Thomaello', 'Thomaz Yeiden Busnardo Aguena', 'Eric Trevelato Costa', 'Rafael Baságlia Rosante', 'Thiago Rodrigo Ramos', 'Daiane Aparecida Zuanetti', 'Edgar Dutra Zanotto']",2025-11-20 13:51:24+00:00,cs.DB,2511.16366v1,1275
On 10x Better Scalability: KV Stores Scale Up KV Cache,"Large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) cache to reduce time- to-first-token (TTFT) latency, but existing disk-based KV cache systems using file-per-object layouts suffer from severe scalability bottlenecks due to file system metadata overhead, I/O inefficiency, and poor spatial locality. This paper presents SGLANG-LSM, a database-inspired system that leverages Log-Structured Merge- tree (LSM-tree) architectures for scalable KV cache management. SGLANG-LSM implements a layered system design with three coordinated components: (1) a prefix-preserving storage engine that maintains token sequence locality while efficiently storing large KV cache tensors through key-value separation, (2) an adaptive controller that dynamically optimizes LSM-tree configurations based on shifting workload characteristics, and (3) runtime services including batch opera- tions and automatic resource management for production deployment. Evaluation on large-scale dynamic workloads demonstrates that SGLANG-LSM significantly improves cache hits by up to 143% and reduces TTFT by up to 24% compared to state-of-the-art systems, representing the first systematic application of database storage architectures to large-scale LLM cache management.","['Weiping Yu', 'Ye Jiarui', 'He Mengke', 'Junfeng Liu', 'Siqiang Luo']",2025-11-20 08:22:36+00:00,cs.DB,2511.16138v1,1242
Benchmarking Table Extraction from Heterogeneous Scientific Extraction Documents,"Table Extraction (TE) consists in extracting tables from PDF documents, in a structured format which can be automatically processed. While numerous TE tools exist, the variety of methods and techniques makes it difficult for users to choose an appropriate one. We propose a novel benchmark for assessing end-to-end TE methods (from PDF to the final table). We contribute an analysis of TE evaluation metrics, and the design of a rigorous evaluation process, which allows scoring each TE sub-task as well as end-to-end TE, and captures model uncertainty. Along with a prior dataset, our benchmark comprises two new heterogeneous datasets of 37k samples. We run our benchmark on diverse models, including off-the-shelf libraries, software tools, large vision language models, and approaches based on computer vision. The results demonstrate that TE remains challenging: current methods suffer from a lack of generalizability when facing heterogeneous data, and from limitations in robustness and interpretability.","['Marijan Soric', 'Cécile Gracianne', 'Ioana Manolescu', 'Pierre Senellart']",2025-11-20 08:09:48+00:00,cs.DB,2511.16134v1,1011
AskDB: An LLM Agent for Natural Language Interaction with Relational Databases,"Interacting with relational databases remains challenging for users across different expertise levels, particularly when composing complex analytical queries or performing administrative tasks. Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.","['Xuan-Quang Phan', 'Tan-Ha Mai', 'Thai-Duy Dinh', 'Minh-Thuan Nguyen', 'Lam-Son Lê']",2025-11-20 08:06:09+00:00,cs.DB,2511.16131v1,1341

A Decade of Systems for Human Data Interaction,"Human-data interaction (HDI) presents fundamentally different challenges from traditional data management. HDI systems must meet latency, correctness, and consistency needs that stem from usability rather than query semantics; failing to meet these expectations breaks the user experience. Moreover, interfaces and systems are tightly coupled; neither can easily be optimized in isolation, and effective solutions demand their co-design. This dependence also presents a research opportunity: rather than adapt systems to interface demands, systems innovations and database theory can also inspire new interaction and visualization designs. We survey a decade of our lab's work that embraces this coupling and argue that HDI systems are the foundation for reliable, interactive, AI-driven applications.","['Eugene Wu', 'Yiru Chen', 'Haneen Mohammed', 'Zezhou Huang']",2025-11-19 16:17:05+00:00,cs.DB,2511.15585v1,801
B+ANN: A Fast Billion-Scale Disk-based Nearest-Neighbor Index,"Storing and processing of embedding vectors by specialized Vector databases (VDBs) has become the linchpin in building modern AI pipelines. Most current VDBs employ variants of a graph-based ap- proximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) index algorithm, HNSW, to an- swer semantic queries over stored vectors. Inspite of its wide-spread use, the HNSW algorithm suffers from several issues: in-memory design and implementation, random memory accesses leading to degradation in cache behavior, limited acceleration scope due to fine-grained pairwise computations, and support of only semantic similarity queries. In this paper, we present a novel disk-based ANN index, B+ANN, to address these issues: it first partitions input data into blocks containing semantically similar items, then builds an B+ tree variant to store blocks both in-memory and on disks, and finally, enables hybrid edge- and block-based in-memory traversals. As demonstrated by our experimantal evaluation, the proposed B+ANN disk-based index improves both quality (Recall value), and execution performance (Queries per second/QPS) over HNSW, by improving spatial and temporal locality for semantic operations, reducing cache misses (19.23% relative gain), and decreasing the memory consumption and disk-based build time by 24x over the DiskANN algorithm. Finally, it enables dissimilarity queries, which are not supported by similarity-oriented ANN indices.","['Selim Furkan Tekin', 'Rajesh Bordawekar']",2025-11-19 15:50:28+00:00,cs.DB,2511.15557v1,1419
BBox DocVQA: A Large Scale Bounding Box Grounded Dataset for Enhancing Reasoning in Document Visual Question Answer,"Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) is a fundamental task for multimodal document understanding and a key testbed for vision language reasoning. However, most existing DocVQA datasets are limited to the page level and lack fine grained spatial grounding, constraining the interpretability and reasoning capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance. The resulting dataset contains 3.6 K diverse documents and 32 K QA pairs, encompassing single and multi region as well as single and multi page scenarios. Each QA instance is grounded on explicit bounding boxes, enabling fine grained evaluation of spatial semantic alignment. Benchmarking multiple state of the art VLMs (e.g., GPT 5, Qwen2.5 VL, and InternVL) on BBox DocVQA reveals persistent challenges in spatial grounding and reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, fine tuning on BBox DocVQA substantially improves both bounding box localization and answer generation, validating its effectiveness for enhancing the reasoning ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be publicly released to advance research on interpretable and spatially grounded vision language reasoning.","['Wenhan Yu', 'Wang Chen', 'Guanqiang Qi', 'Weikang Li', 'Yang Li', 'Lei Sha', 'Deguo Xia', 'Jizhou Huang']",2025-11-19 04:03:54+00:00,cs.DB,2511.15090v1,1587
Compiling Set Queries into Work-Efficient Tree Traversals,"Trees can accelerate queries that search or aggregate values over large collections. They achieve this by storing metadata that enables quick pruning (or inclusion) of subtrees when predicates on that metadata can prove that none (or all) of the data in a subtree affect the query result. Existing systems implement this pruning logic manually for each query predicate and data structure. We generalize and mechanize this class of optimization. Our method derives conditions for when subtrees can be pruned (or included wholesale), expressed in terms of the metadata available at each node. We efficiently generate these conditions using symbolic interval analysis, extended with new rules to handle geometric predicates (e.g., intersection, containment). Additionally, our compiler fuses compound queries (e.g., reductions on filters) into a single tree traversal. These techniques enable the automatic derivation of generalized single-index and dual-index tree joins that support a wide class of join predicates beyond standard equality and range predicates. The generated traversals match the behavior of expert-written code that implements query-specific traversals, and can asymptotically outperform the linear scans and nested-loop joins that existing systems fall back to when hand-written cases do not apply.","['Alexander J Root', 'Christophe Gyurgyik', 'Purvi Goel', 'Kayvon Fatahalian', 'Jonathan Ragan-Kelley', 'Andrew Adams', 'Fredrik Kjolstad']",2025-11-19 00:50:20+00:00,cs.PL,2511.15000v1,1316
Cloud-Native Vector Search: A Comprehensive Performance Analysis,"Vector search has been widely employed in recommender system and retrieval-augmented-generation pipelines, commonly performed with vector indexes to efficiently find similar items in large datasets. Recent growths in both data and task complexity have motivated placing vector indexes onto remote storage -- cloud-native vector search, which cloud providers have recently introduced services for. Yet, despite varying workload characteristics and various available vector index forms, providers default to using cluster-based indexes, which on paper do adapt well to differences between disk and cloud-based environment: their fetch granularities and lack of notable intra-query dependencies aligns with the large optimal fetch sizes and minimizes costly round-trips (i.e., as opposed to graph-based indexes) to remote storage, respectively.
  This paper systematically studies cloud-native vector search: What and how should indexes be built and used for on-cloud vector search? We analyze bottlenecks of two common index classes, cluster and graph indexes, on remote storage, and show that despite current standardized adoption of cluster indexes on the cloud, graph indexes are favored in workloads requiring high concurrency and recall, or operating on high-dimensional data or large datatypes. We further find that on-cloud search demands significantly different indexing and search parameterizations versus on-disk search for optimal performance. Finally, we incorporate existing cloud-based caching setups into vector search and find that certain index optimizations work against caching, and study how this can be mitigated to maximize gains under various available cache sizes.","['Zhaoheng Li', 'Wei Ding', 'Silu Huang', 'Zikang Wang', 'Yuanjin Lin', 'Ke Wu', 'Yongjoo Park', 'Jianjun Chen']",2025-11-18 18:50:15+00:00,cs.DB,2511.14748v1,1686
Natural Language Interfaces for Databases: What Do Users Think?,"Natural Language Interfaces for Databases (NLIDBs) aim to make database querying accessible by allowing users to ask questions in everyday language rather than using formal SQL queries. Despite significant advancements in translation accuracy, critical usability challenges, such as user frustration, query refinement strategies, and error recovery, remain underexplored. To investigate these usability dimensions, we conducted a mixed-method user study comparing SQL-LLM, a state-of-the-art NL2SQL system, with Snowflake, a traditional SQL analytics platform. Our controlled evaluation involved 20 participants completing realistic database querying tasks across 12 queries each. Results show that SQL-LLM significantly reduced query completion times by 10 to 30 percent (mean: 418 s vs. 629 s, p = 0.036) and improved overall accuracy from 50 to 75 percent (p = 0.002). Additionally, participants using SQL-LLM exhibited fewer query reformulations, recovered from errors 30 to 40 seconds faster, and reported lower frustration levels compared to Snowflake users. Behavioral analysis revealed that SQL-LLM encouraged structured, schema-first querying strategies, enhancing user confidence and efficiency, particularly for complex queries. These findings underscore the practical significance of well-designed, user-friendly NLIDBs in business analytics settings, emphasizing the critical role of usability alongside technical accuracy in real-world deployments.","['Panos Ipeirotis', 'Haotian Zheng']",2025-11-18 18:04:24+00:00,cs.DB,2511.14718v1,1462
Scalable Enforcement of Fine Grained Access Control Policies in Relational Database Management Systems,"The proliferation of smart technologies and evolving privacy regulations such as the GDPR and CPRA has increased the need to manage fine-grained access control (FGAC) policies in database management systems (DBMSs). Existing approaches to enforcing FGAC policies do not scale to thousands of policies, leading to degraded query performance and reduced system effectiveness. We present Sieve, a middleware for relational DBMSs that combines query rewriting and caching to optimize FGAC policy enforcement. Sieve rewrites a query with guarded expressions that group and filter policies and can efficiently use indexes in the DBMS. It also integrates a caching mechanism with an effective replacement strategy and a refresh mechanism to adapt to dynamic workloads. Experiments on two DBMSs with real and synthetic datasets show that Sieve scales to large datasets and policy corpora, maintaining low query latency and system load and improving policy evaluation performance by between 2x and 10x on workloads with 200 to 1,200 policies. The caching extension further improves query performance by between 6 and 22 percent under dynamic workloads, especially with larger cache sizes. These results highlight Sieve's applicability for real-time access control in smart environments and its support for efficient, scalable management of user preferences and privacy policies.","['Anadi Shakya', 'Primal Pappachan', 'David Maier', 'Roberto Yus', 'Sharad Mehrotra', 'Johann-Christoph Freytag']",2025-11-18 16:20:47+00:00,cs.DB,2511.14629v1,1369

Gradient-Based Join Ordering,"Join ordering is the NP-hard problem of selecting the most efficient sequence in which to evaluate joins (conjunctive, binary operators) in a database query. As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future.","['Tim Schwabe', 'Maribel Acosta']",2025-11-18 13:24:28+00:00,cs.DB,2511.14482v1,1421
Chipmink: Efficient Delta Identification for Massive Object Graph,"Ranging from batch scripts to computational notebooks, modern data science tools rely on massive and evolving object graphs that represent structured data, models, plots, and more. Persisting these objects is critical, not only to enhance system robustness against unexpected failures but also to support continuous, non-linear data exploration via versioning. Existing object persistence mechanisms (e.g., Pickle, Dill) rely on complete snapshotting, often redundantly storing unchanged objects during execution and exploration, resulting in significant inefficiency in both time and storage. Unlike DBMSs, data science systems lack centralized buffer managers that track dirty objects. Worse, object states span various locations such as memory heaps, shared memory, GPUs, and remote machines, making dirty object identification fundamentally more challenging. In this work, we propose a graph-based object store, named Chipmink, that acts like the centralized buffer manager. Unlike static pages in DBMSs, persistence units in Chipmink are dynamically induced by partitioning objects into appropriate subgroups (called pods), minimizing expected persistence costs based on object sizes and reference structure. These pods effectively isolate dirty objects, enabling efficient partial persistence. Our experiments show that Chipmink is general, supporting libraries that rely on shared memory, GPUs, and remote objects. Moreover, Chipmink achieves up to 36.5x smaller storage sizes and 12.4x faster persistence than the best baselines in real-world notebooks and scripts.","['Supawit Chockchowwat', 'Sumay Thakurdesai', 'Zhaoheng Li', 'Matthew Krafczyk', 'Yongjoo Park']",2025-11-18 05:54:24+00:00,cs.DB,2511.14162v1,1573
Fast Verification of Strong Database Isolation (Extended Version),"Strong isolation guarantees, such as serializability and snapshot isolation, are essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity in modern databases. Verifying whether a database upholds its claimed guarantees is increasingly critical, as these guarantees form a contract between the vendor and its users. However, this task is challenging, particularly in black-box settings, where only observable system behavior is available and often involves uncertain dependencies between transactions.
  In this paper, we present VeriStrong, a fast verifier for strong database isolation. At its core is a novel formalism called hyper-polygraphs, which compactly captures both certain and uncertain transactional dependencies in database executions. Leveraging this formalism, we develop sound and complete encodings for verifying both serializability and snapshot isolation. To achieve high efficiency, VeriStrong tailors SMT solving to the characteristics of database workloads, in contrast to prior general-purpose approaches. Our extensive evaluation across diverse benchmarks shows that VeriStrong not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art verifiers on the workloads they support, but also scales to large, general workloads beyond their reach, while maintaining high accuracy in detecting isolation anomalies.","['Zhiheng Cai', 'Si Liu', 'Hengfeng Wei', 'Yuxing Chen', 'Anqun Pan']",2025-11-18 02:48:52+00:00,cs.DB,2511.14067v1,1324
SQL-to-Text Generation with Weighted-AST Few-Shot Prompting,"SQL-to-Text generation aims at translating structured SQL queries into natural language descriptions, thereby facilitating comprehension of complex database operations for non-technical users. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising results, current methods often fail to maintain the exact semantics of SQL queries, particularly when there are multiple possible correct phrasings. To address this problem, our work proposes Weighted-AST retrieval with prompting, an architecture that integrates structural query representations and LLM prompting. This method retrieves semantically relevant examples as few-shot prompts using a similarity metric based on an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with learned feature weights. Our structure-aware prompting technique ensures that generated descriptions are both fluent and faithful to the original query logic. Numerous experiments on three benchmark datasets - Spider, SParC, and CoSQL show that our method outperforms the current baselines by up to +17.24% in execution Accuracy (EX), performs superior in Exact Match (EM) and provides more consistent semantic fidelity when evaluated by humans, all while preserving competitive runtime performance. These results demonstrate that Weighted-AST prompting is a scalable and effective method for deriving natural language explanations from structured database queries.","['Sriom Chakrabarti', 'Chuangtao Ma', 'Arijit Khan', 'Sebastian Link']",2025-11-17 21:01:43+00:00,cs.DB,2511.13907v1,1391
Exploring Multi-Table Retrieval Through Iterative Search,"Open-domain question answering over datalakes requires retrieving and composing information from multiple tables, a challenging subtask that demands semantic relevance and structural coherence (e.g., joinability). While exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) can ensure coherence, their computational complexity is often prohibitive. Conversely, simpler greedy heuristics that optimize for query coverage alone often fail to find these coherent, joinable sets. This paper frames multi-table retrieval as an iterative search process, arguing this approach offers advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility. We propose a general framework and a concrete instantiation: a fast, effective Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval algorithm that holistically balances relevance, coverage, and joinability. Experiments across 5 NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our iterative method achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to the MIP-based approach while being 4-400x faster depending on the benchmark and search space settings. This work highlights the potential of iterative heuristics for practical, scalable, and composition-aware retrieval.","['Allaa Boutaleb', 'Bernd Amann', 'Rafael Angarita', 'Hubert Naacke']",2025-11-17 14:31:33+00:00,cs.IR,2511.13418v1,1182
Redbench: Workload Synthesis From Cloud Traces,"Workload traces from cloud data warehouse providers reveal that standard benchmarks such as TPC-H and TPC-DS fail to capture key characteristics of real-world workloads, including query repetition and string-heavy queries. In this paper, we introduce Redbench, a novel benchmark featuring a workload generator that reproduces real-world workload characteristics derived from traces released by cloud providers. Redbench integrates multiple workload generation techniques to tailor workloads to specific objectives, transforming existing benchmarks into realistic query streams that preserve intrinsic workload characteristics. By focusing on inherent workload signals rather than execution-specific metrics, Redbench bridges the gap between synthetic and real workloads. Our evaluation shows that (1) Redbench produces more realistic and reproducible workloads for cloud data warehouse benchmarking, and (2) Redbench reveals the impact of system optimizations across four commercial data warehouse platforms. We believe that Redbench provides a crucial foundation for advancing research on optimization techniques for modern cloud data warehouses.","['Johannes Wehrstein', 'Roman Heinrich', 'Mihail Stoian', 'Skander Krid', 'Martin Stemmer', 'Andreas Kipf', 'Carsten Binnig', 'Muhammad El-Hindi']",2025-11-17 07:06:27+00:00,cs.DB,2511.13059v1,1147
ZX-DB: A Graph Database for Quantum Circuit Simplification and Rewriting via the ZX-Calculus,"Quantum computing is an emerging computational paradigm with the potential to outperform classical computers in solving a variety of problems. To achieve this, quantum programs are typically represented as quantum circuits, which must be optimized and adapted for target hardware through quantum circuit compilation. We introduce ZX-DB, a data-driven system that performs quantum circuit simplification and rewriting inside a graph database using ZX-calculus, a complete graphical formalism for quantum mechanics. ZX-DB encodes ZX-calculus rewrite rules as standard openCypher queries and executes them on an example graph database engine, Memgraph, enabling efficient, database-native transformations of large-scale quantum circuits. ZX-DB integrates correctness validation via tensor and graph equivalence checks and is evaluated against the state-of-the-art PyZX framework. Experimental results show that ZX-DB achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup for independent rewrites, while exposing pattern-matching bottlenecks in current graph database engines. By uniting quantum compilation and graph data management, ZX-DB opens a new systems direction toward scalable, database-supported quantum computing pipelines.","['Valter Uotila', 'Cong Yu', 'Bo Zhao']",2025-11-17 06:33:18+00:00,quant-ph,2511.13033v1,1222
RAGPulse: An Open-Source RAG Workload Trace to Optimize RAG Serving Systems,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical paradigm for building reliable, knowledge-intensive Large Language Model (LLM) applications. However, the multi-stage pipeline (retrieve, generate) and unique workload characteristics (e.g., knowledge dependency) of RAG systems pose significant challenges for serving performance optimization. Existing generic LLM inference traces fail to capture these RAG-specific dynamics, creating a significant performance gap between academic research and real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RAGPulse, an open-source RAG workload trace dataset. This dataset was collected from an university-wide Q&A system serving that has served more than 40,000 students and faculties since April 2024. We detail RAGPulse's system architecture, its privacy-preserving hash-based data format, and provide an in-depth statistical analysis. Our analysis reveals that real-world RAG workloads exhibit significant temporal locality and a highly skewed hot document access pattern. RAGPulse provides a high-fidelity foundation for researchers to develop and validate novel optimization strategies for RAG systems, such as content-aware batching and retrieval caching, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of RAG services.

SEE++: Evolving Snowpark Execution Environment for Modern Workloads,"Snowpark enables Data Engineering and AI/ML workloads to run directly within Snowflake by deploying a secure sandbox on virtual warehouse nodes. This Snowpark Execution Environment (SEE) allows users to execute arbitrary workloads in Python and other languages in a secure and performant manner. As adoption has grown, the diversity of workloads has introduced increasingly sophisticated needs for sandboxing. To address these evolving requirements, Snowpark transitioned its in-house sandboxing solution to gVisor, augmented with targeted optimizations. This paper describes both the functional and performance objectives that guided the upgrade, outlines the new sandbox architecture, and details the challenges encountered during the journey, along with the solutions developed to resolve them. Finally, we present case studies that highlight new features enabled by the upgraded architecture, demonstrating SEE's extensibility and flexibility in supporting the next generation of Snowpark workloads.","['Gaurav Jain', 'Brandon Baker', 'Joe Yin', 'Chenwei Xie', 'Zihao Ye', 'Sidh Kulkarni', 'Sara Abdelrahman', 'Nova Qi', 'Urjeet Shrestha', 'Mike Halcrow', 'Dave Bailey', 'Yuxiong He']",2025-11-16 05:07:27+00:00,cs.DB,2511.12457v1,1003
MovSemCL: Movement-Semantics Contrastive Learning for Trajectory Similarity,"Trajectory similarity computation is fundamental functionality that is used for, e.g., clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.","['Zhichen Lai', 'Hua Lu', 'Huan Li', 'Jialiang Li', 'Christian S.

GenIE - Simulator-Driven Iterative Data Exploration for Scientific Discovery,"Physics-based simulators play a critical role in scientific discovery and risk assessment, enabling what-if analyses for events like wildfires and hurricanes. Today, databases treat these simulators as external pre-processing steps. Analysts must manually run a simulation, export the results, and load them into a database before analysis can begin. This linear workflow is inefficient, incurs high latency, and hinders interactive exploration, especially when the analysis itself dictates the need for new or refined simulation data.
  We envision a new database paradigm, entitled GenIE, that seamlessly integrates multiple simulators into databases to enable dynamic orchestration of simulation workflows. By making the database ""simulation-aware,"" GenIE can dynamically invoke simulators with appropriate parameters based on the user's query and analytical needs. This tight integration allows GenIE to avoid generating data irrelevant to the analysis, reuse previously generated data, and support iterative, incremental analysis where results are progressively refined at interactive speeds.
  We present our vision for GenIE, designed as an extension to PostgreSQL, and demonstrate its potential benefits through comprehensive use cases: wildfire smoke dispersion analysis using WRF-SFIRE and HYSPLIT, and hurricane hazard assessment integrating wind, surge, and flood models. Our preliminary experiments show how GenIE can transform these slow, static analyses into interactive explorations by intelligently managing the trade-off between simulation accuracy and runtime across multiple integrated simulators. We conclude by highlighting the challenges and opportunities ahead in realizing the full vision of GenIE as a cornerstone for next-generation scientific data analysis.","['Ashwin Gerard Colaco', 'Martin Boissier', 'Sriram Rao', 'Shubharoop Ghosh', 'Sharad Mehrotra', 'Tilmann Rabl']",2025-11-15 06:50:04+00:00,cs.DB,2511.12057v1,1785
"Flash-Fusion: Enabling Expressive, Low-Latency Queries on IoT Sensor Streams with LLMs","Smart cities and pervasive IoT deployments have generated interest in IoT data analysis across transportation and urban planning. At the same time, Large Language Models offer a new interface for exploring IoT data - particularly through natural language. Users today face two key challenges when working with IoT data using LLMs: (1) data collection infrastructure is expensive, producing terabytes of low-level sensor readings that are too granular for direct use, and (2) data analysis is slow, requiring iterative effort and technical expertise. Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies. What is missing is a system that first parses a user's query to identify the analytical task, then selects the relevant data slices, and finally chooses the right representation before invoking an LLM.
  We present Flash-Fusion, an end-to-end edge-cloud system that reduces the IoT data collection and analysis burden on users. Two principles guide its design: (1) edge-based statistical summarization (achieving 73.5% data reduction) to address data volume, and (2) cloud-based query planning that clusters behavioral data and assembles context-rich prompts to address data interpretation. We deploy Flash-Fusion on a university bus fleet and evaluate it against a baseline that feeds raw data to a state-of-the-art LLM. Flash-Fusion achieves a 95% latency reduction and 98% decrease in token usage and cost while maintaining high-quality responses. It enables personas across disciplines - safety officers, urban planners, fleet managers, and data scientists - to efficiently iterate over IoT data without the burden of manual query authoring or preprocessing.","['Kausar Patherya', 'Ashutosh Dhekne', 'Francisco Romero']",2025-11-14 21:34:28+00:00,cs.DC,2511.11885v1,1766
HetDAPAC: Leveraging Attribute Heterogeneity in Distributed Attribute-Based Private Access Control,"Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.","['Shreya Meel', 'Sennur Ulukus']",2025-11-14 18:40:17+00:00,cs.CR,2511.11549v1,1910
Unlocking Advanced Graph Machine Learning Insights through Knowledge Completion on Neo4j Graph Database,"Graph Machine Learning (GML) with Graph Databases (GDBs) has gained significant relevance in recent years, due to its ability to handle complex interconnected data and apply ML techniques using Graph Data Science (GDS). However, a critical gap exists in the current way GDB-GML applications analyze data, especially in terms of Knowledge Completion (KC) in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In particular, current architectures ignore KC, working on datasets that appear incomplete or fragmented, despite they actually contain valuable hidden knowledge. This limitation may cause wrong interpretations when these data are used as input for GML models.
  This paper proposes an innovative architecture that integrates a KC phase into GDB-GML applications, demonstrating how revealing hidden knowledge can heavily impact datasets' behavior and metrics. For this purpose, we introduce scalable transitive relationships, which are links that propagate information over the network and modelled by a decay function, allowing a deterministic knowledge flows across multiple nodes.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our intuition radically reshapes both topology and overall dataset dynamics, underscoring the need for this new GDB-GML architecture to produce better models and unlock the full potential of graph-based data analysis.","['Rosario Napoli', 'Antonio Celesti', 'Massimo Villari', 'Maria Fazio']",2025-11-14 15:27:31+00:00,cs.DB,2511.11399v1,1322
ResBench: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Database Resilience,"Existing database benchmarks primarily focus on performance under ideal running environments. However, in real-world scenarios, databases probably face numerous adverse events. Quantifying the ability to cope with these events from a comprehensive perspective remains an open problem. We provide the definition of database resilience to describe its performance when facing adversity and propose ResBench, a benchmark for evaluating database resilience. This framework achieves automation, standardization, and visualization of the testing process through clear hierarchical decoupling. ResBench simulates adverse events and injects them during normal transaction processing, utilizing a module to gather multiple metrics for the evaluation model. We assess database resilience across eight dimensions: throughput, latency, stability, resistance, recovery, disturbance period, adaptation capability and metric deviation. All the results are presented to users via a user-friendly graphical interface. We demonstrate the execution process and result interpretation of ResBench using two types of adversity datasets.","['Puyun Hu', 'Wei Pan', 'Xun Jian', 'Zeqi Ma', 'Tianjie Li', 'Yang Shen', 'Chengzhi Han', 'Yudong Zhao', 'Zhanhuai Li']",2025-11-14 09:09:15+00:00,cs.DB,2511.11088v1,1114
How Data Quality Affects Machine Learning Models for Credit Risk Assessment,"Machine Learning (ML) models are being increasingly employed for credit risk evaluation, with their effectiveness largely hinging on the quality of the input data. In this paper we investigate the impact of several data quality issues, including missing values, noisy attributes, outliers, and label errors, on the predictive accuracy of the machine learning model used in credit risk assessment. Utilizing an open-source dataset, we introduce controlled data corruption using the Pucktrick library to assess the robustness of 10 frequently used models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression and so on.

HyperComplEx: Adaptive Multi-Space Knowledge Graph Embeddings,"Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation.

To address these issues, we introduce Brazil Data Commons, a platform that unifies various Brazilian datasets under a common semantic framework, enabling the seamless discovery, integration and visualization of information from different domains. By adopting globally recognized ontologies and interoperable data standards, Brazil Data Commons aligns with the principles of the broader Data Commons ecosystem and places Brazilian data in a global context. Through user-friendly interfaces, straightforward query mechanisms and flexible data access options, the platform democratizes data use and enables researchers, policy makers, and the public to gain meaningful insights and make informed decisions.

To address these challenges, we present CityVerse, the first unified platform integrating multi-source urban data, capability-based task taxonomy, and dynamic simulation for systematic LLM evaluation in urban contexts.

Text2SQL-Flow: A Robust SQL-Aware Data Augmentation Framework for Text-to-SQL,"The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique.

Dolphin: An Actor-Oriented Database for Reactive Moving Object Data Management,"Novel reactive moving object applications require solutions to support object reactive behaviors as a way to query and update dynamic data. While moving object scenarios have long been researched in the context of spatio-temporal data management, reactive behavior is usually left to complex end-user implementations. However, it is not just a matter of hardwiring reactive constraints: the required solutions need to satisfy tight low-latency computation requirements and be scalable. This paper explores a novel approach to enrich a distributed actor-based framework with reactive functionality and complex spatial data management along with concurrency semantics. Our approach relies on a proposal of the moving actor abstraction, which is a conceptual enhancement of the actor model with reactive sensing, movement, and spatial querying capabilities. This enhancement helps developers of reactive moving object applications avoid the significant burden of implementing application-level schemes to balance performance and consistency. Based on moving actors, we define a reactive moving object data management platform, named Moving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs), and build Dolphin -- an implementation of M-AODBs. Dolphin embodies a non-intrusive actor-based design layered on top of the Microsoft Orleans distributed virtual actor framework. In a set of experimental evaluations with realistic reactive moving object scenarios, Dolphin exhibits scalability on multi-machines and provides near-real-time reaction latency.","['Yiwen Wang', 'Vivek Shah', 'Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles', 'Claudia Bauzer Medeiros', 'Julio Cesar Dos Reis', 'Yongluan Zhou']",2025-11-13 08:05:09+00:00,cs.DB,2511.10063v1,1531
DemoTuner: Efficient DBMS Knobs Tuning via LLM-Assisted Demonstration Reinforcement Learning,"The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.","['Hui Dou', 'Lei Jin', 'Yuxuan Zhou', 'Jiang He', 'Yiwen Zhang']",2025-11-13 06:06:58+00:00,cs.LG,2511.09998v1,1774
"TempoQL: A Readable, Precise, and Portable Query System for Electronic Health Record Data","Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling.

This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance.

CheetahGIS: Architecting a Scalable and Efficient Streaming Spatial Query Processing System,"Spatial data analytics systems are widely studied in both the academia and industry. However, existing systems are limited when handling a large number of moving objects and real time spatial queries. In this work, we architect a scalable and efficient system CheetahGIS to process streaming spatial queries over massive moving objects. In particular, CheetahGIS is built upon Apache Flink Stateful Functions (StateFun), an API for building distributed streaming applications with an actor-like model. CheetahGIS enjoys excellent scalability due to its modular architecture, which clearly decomposes different components and allows scaling individual components. To improve the efficiency and scalability of CheetahGIS, we devise a suite of optimizations, e.g., lightweight global grid-based index, metadata synchroniza tion strategies, and load balance mechanisms. We also formulate a generic paradigm for spatial query processing in CheetahGIS, and verify its generality by processing three representative streaming queries (i.e., object query, range count query, and k nearest neighbor query). We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to evaluate CheetahGIS.","['Jiaping Cao', 'Ting Sun', 'Man Lung Yiu', 'Xiao Yan', 'Bo Tang']",2025-11-12 12:23:47+00:00,cs.DB,2511.09262v1,1189
"Efficient Distributed Exact Subgraph Matching via GNN-PE: Load Balancing, Cache Optimization, and Query Plan Ranking","Exact subgraph matching on large-scale graphs remains a challenging problem due to high computational complexity and distributed system constraints.

To address this gap, we propose three core innovations to extend GNN-PE to distributed systems: (1) a lightweight dynamic correlation-aware load balancing and hot migration mechanism that fuses multi-dimensional metrics (CPU, communication, memory) and guarantees index consistency; (2) an online incremental learning-based multi-GPU collaborative dynamic caching strategy with heterogeneous GPU adaptation and graph-structure-aware replacement; (3) a query plan ranking method driven by dominance embedding pruning potential (PE-score) that optimizes execution order.

Contextual Graph Embeddings: Accounting for Data Characteristics in Heterogeneous Data Integration,"As organizations continue to access diverse datasets, the demand for effective data integration has increased. Key tasks in this process, such as schema matching and entity resolution, are essential but often require significant effort. Although previous studies have aimed to automate these tasks, the influence of dataset characteristics on the matching effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined, and combinations of different methods remain limited. This study introduces a contextual graph embedding technique that integrates structural details from tabular data and contextual elements such as column descriptions and external knowledge. Tests conducted on datasets with varying properties such as domain specificity, data size, missing rate, and overlap rate showed that our approach consistently surpassed existing graph-based methods, especially in difficult scenarios such those with a high proportion of numerical values or significant missing data. However, we identified specific failure cases, such as columns that were semantically similar but distinct, which remains a challenge for our method. The study highlights two main insights: (i) contextual embeddings enhance the matching reliability, and (ii) dataset characteristics significantly affect the integration outcomes. These contributions can advance the development of practical data integration systems that can support real-world enterprise applications.","['Yuka Haruki', 'Shigeru Ishikura', 'Kazuya Demachi', 'Teruaki Hayashi']",2025-11-12 05:45:46+00:00,cs.DB,2511.09001v1,1433
FlashMap: A Flash Optimized Key-Value Store,"Key-value stores are a fundamental class of NoSQL databases that offer a simple yet powerful model for data storage and retrieval, representing information as pairs of unique keys and associated values. Their minimal structure enables exceptionally fast access times, scalability, and flexibility in storing diverse data types, making them ideal for high-performance applications such as caching, session management, and distributed systems. As modern computing increasingly demands responsiveness and scalability, key-value stores have become a critical component of the data infrastructure in both industry and research contexts. In this work, we present FlashMap, a high-performance key-value store optimized for Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs). Experiments show that FlashMap achieves outstanding throughput, averaging 19.8 million inserts and 23.8 million random lookups per second with a 100-byte payload, all on a single data center-grade server.","['Zonglin Guo', 'Tony Givargis']",2025-11-11 22:48:29+00:00,cs.DB,2511.08826v1,959
ACGraph: An Efficient Asynchronous Out-of-Core Graph Processing Framework,"Graphs are a ubiquitous data structure in diverse domains such as machine learning, social networks, and data mining. As real-world graphs continue to grow beyond the memory capacity of single machines, out-of-core graph processing systems have emerged as a viable solution. Yet, existing systems that rely on strictly synchronous, iteration-by-iteration execution incur significant overheads. In particular, their scheduling mechanisms lead to I/O inefficiencies, stemming from read and work amplification, and induce costly synchronization stalls hindering sustained disk utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present {\em ACGraph}, a novel asynchronous graph processing system optimized for SSD-based environments with constrained memory resources. ACGraph employs a dynamic, block-centric priority scheduler that adjusts in real time based on workload, along with an online asynchronous worklist that minimizes redundant disk accesses by efficiently reusing active blocks in memory. Moreover, ACGraph unifies asynchronous I/O with computation in a pipelined execution model that maintains sustained I/O activation, and leverages a highly optimized hybrid storage format to expedite access to low-degree vertices. We implement popular graph algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Weakly Connected Components (WCC), personalized PageRank (PPR), PageRank (PR), and $k$-core on ACGraph and demonstrate that ACGraph substantially outperforms state-of-the-art out-of-core graph processing systems in both runtime and I/O efficiency.","['Dechuang Chen', 'Sibo Wang', 'Qintian Guo']",2025-11-11 06:33:50+00:00,cs.DB,2511.07886v1,1548
Cortex AISQL: A Production SQL Engine for Unstructured Data,"Snowflake's Cortex AISQL is a production SQL engine that integrates native semantic operations directly into SQL. This integration allows users to write declarative queries that combine relational operations with semantic reasoning, enabling them to query both structured and unstructured data effortlessly. However, making semantic operations efficient at production scale poses fundamental challenges. Semantic operations are more expensive than traditional SQL operations, possess distinct latency and throughput characteristics, and their cost and selectivity are unknown during query compilation. Furthermore, existing query engines are not designed to optimize semantic operations. The AISQL query execution engine addresses these challenges through three novel techniques informed by production deployment data from Snowflake customers. First, AI-aware query optimization treats AI inference cost as a first-class optimization objective, reasoning about large language model (LLM) cost directly during query planning to achieve 2-8$\times$ speedups. Second, adaptive model cascades reduce inference costs by routing most rows through a fast proxy model while escalating uncertain cases to a powerful oracle model, achieving 2-6$\times$ speedups while maintaining 90-95% of oracle model quality. Third, semantic join query rewriting lowers the quadratic time complexity of join operations to linear through reformulation as multi-label classification tasks, achieving 15-70$\times$ speedups with often improved prediction quality. AISQL is deployed in production at Snowflake, where it powers diverse customer workloads across analytics, search, and content understanding.","['Paweł Liskowski', 'Benjamin Han', 'Paritosh Aggarwal', 'Bowei Chen', 'Boxin Jiang', 'Nitish Jindal', 'Zihan Li', 'Aaron Lin', 'Kyle Schmaus', 'Jay Tayade', 'Weicheng Zhao', 'Anupam Datta', 'Nathan Wiegand', 'Dimitris Tsirogiannis']",2025-11-10 22:14:13+00:00,cs.DB,2511.07663v2,1678
A Service Suite for Specifying Digital Twins for Industry 5.0,"One of the challenges of predictive maintenance is making decisions based on data in an agile and assertive way. Connected sensors and operational data favor intelligent processing techniques to enrich information and enable decision-making. Digital Twins (DTs) can be used to process information and support decision-making. DTs are a real-time representation of physical machines and generate data that predictive maintenance can use to make assertive and quick decisions. The main contribution of this work is the specification of a suite of services for specifying DTs, called DT-Create, focused on decision support in predictive maintenance. DT-Create suite is based on intelligent techniques, semantic data processing, and self-adaptation. This suite was developed using the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology through two development cycles and evaluated through case studies. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using DT-Create in specifying DTs considering the following aspects: (i) collection, storage, and intelligent processing of data generated by sensors, (ii) enrichment of information through machine learning and ontologies, (iii) use of intelligent techniques to select predictive models that adhere to the available data set, and (iv) decision support and self-adaptation.","['Izaque Esteves', 'Regina Braga', 'José Maria David', 'Victor Stroele']",2025-11-10 18:40:01+00:00,cs.SE,2511.07506v1,1305
Trading Vector Data in Vector Databases,"Vector data trading is essential for cross-domain learning with vector databases, yet it remains largely unexplored. We study this problem under online learning, where sellers face uncertain retrieval costs and buyers provide stochastic feedback to posted prices. Three main challenges arise: (1) heterogeneous and partial feedback in configuration learning, (2) variable and complex feedback in pricing learning, and (3) inherent coupling between configuration and pricing decisions.
  We propose a hierarchical bandit framework that jointly optimizes retrieval configurations and pricing. Stage I employs contextual clustering with confidence-based exploration to learn effective configurations with logarithmic regret. Stage II adopts interval-based price selection with local Taylor approximation to estimate buyer responses and achieve sublinear regret. We establish theoretical guarantees with polynomial time complexity and validate the framework on four real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in cumulative reward and regret reduction compared with existing methods.","['Jin Cheng', 'Xiangxiang Dai', 'Ningning Ding', 'John C.

Ontology, as a structured, information-rich knowledge representation, can provide context, particularly in learning problems. This paper presents OntoTune, an ontology-based platform for enhancing learning for query optimization. By connecting SQL queries, database metadata, and statistics, the ontology developed in this research is promising in capturing relationships and important determinants of query performance. This research also develops a method to embed ontologies while preserving as much of the relationships and key information as possible, before feeding it into learning algorithms such as tree-based and graph-based convolutional networks.

Continual Learning of Domain Knowledge from Human Feedback in Text-to-SQL,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.","['Thomas Cook', 'Kelly Patel', 'Sivapriya Vellaichamy', 'Saba Rahimi', 'Zhen Zeng', 'Sumitra Ganesh']",2025-11-10 05:29:10+00:00,cs.CL,2511.10674v1,1061
A Multi-Agent System for Semantic Mapping of Relational Data to Knowledge Graphs,"Enterprises often maintain multiple databases for storing critical business data in siloed systems, resulting in inefficiencies and challenges with data interoperability. A key to overcoming these challenges lies in integrating disparate data sources, enabling businesses to unlock the full potential of their data. Our work presents a novel approach for integrating multiple databases using knowledge graphs, focusing on the application of large language models as semantic agents for mapping and connecting structured data across systems by leveraging existing vocabularies. The proposed methodology introduces a semantic layer above tables in relational databases, utilizing a system comprising multiple LLM agents that map tables and columns to Schema.org terms.

MemoriesDB: A Temporal-Semantic-Relational Database for Long-Term Agent Memory / Modeling Experience as a Graph of Temporal-Semantic Surfaces,"We introduce MemoriesDB, a unified data architecture designed to avoid decoherence across time, meaning, and relation in long-term computational memory. Each memory is a time-semantic-relational entity-a structure that simultaneously encodes when an event occurred, what it means, and how it connects to other events. Built initially atop PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, MemoriesDB combines the properties of a time-series datastore, a vector database, and a graph system within a single append-only schema. Each memory is represented as a vertex uniquely labeled by its microsecond timestamp and accompanied by low- and high-dimensional normalized embeddings that capture semantic context. Directed edges between memories form labeled relations with per-edge metadata, enabling multiple contextual links between the same vertices. Together these constructs form a time-indexed stack of temporal-semantic surfaces, where edges project as directional arrows in a 1+1-dimensional similarity field, tracing the evolution of meaning through time while maintaining cross-temporal coherence. This formulation supports efficient time-bounded retrieval, hybrid semantic search, and lightweight structural reasoning in a single query path. A working prototype demonstrates scalable recall and contextual reinforcement using standard relational infrastructure, and we discuss extensions toward a columnar backend, distributed clustering, and emergent topic modeling.",['Joel Ward'],2025-11-09 01:41:55+00:00,cs.DB,2511.06179v1,1461
Don't Forget Range Delete! Enhancing LSM-based Key-Value Stores with More Compatible Lookups and Deletes,"LSM-trees are featured by out-of-place updates, where key deletion is handled by inserting a tombstone to mark its staleness instead of removing it in place. This defers actual removal to compactions with greatly reduced overhead. However, this classic strategy struggles with another fundamental operator--range deletes--which removes all keys within a specified range, requiring the system to insert numerous tombstones and causing severe performance issues.
  To address this, modern LSM-based systems introduce range tombstones that record the start and end keys to avoid per-key tombstones. Although this achieves impressive range delete efficiency, such a solution is incompatible with lookups. In particular, our experiments show that point lookup latency can increase by 30% even with just 1% range deletions in workloads. Further to our surprise, this issue has not been raised before, though the range tombstone solution has been employed for more than five years.
  To address this critical performance issue, we propose GLORAN, an efficient range delete method that can be integrated into modern LSM-based systems and offers desirable range deletion performance without compromising point lookup efficiency. It introduces a global index that allows point lookups to quickly locate relevant ranges without retrieving many irrelevant elements, reducing the I/O complexity from O(N/λ) to either O(\log^2 N/(λF)) or O(φ\log N/F), where 1/λis the ratio of range deletes, and φis the FPR of Bloom filters in LSM-trees. Furthermore, we design an entry validity estimator to further enhance expected I/O cost to O(ε\log^2 N/(λF)) for looking up existing keys. Extensive evaluations indicate that GLORAN consistently outperforms baselines, while achieving up to 10.6 times faster point lookups and 2.7 times higher overall throughput compared to the SOTA method.","['Fan Wang', 'Dingheng Mo', 'Siqiang Luo']",2025-11-08 16:04:50+00:00,cs.DB,2511.06061v1,1865
RF-Behavior: A Multimodal Radio-Frequency Dataset for Human Behavior and Emotion Analysis,"Recent research has demonstrated the complementary nature of camera-based and inertial data for modeling human gestures, activities, and sentiment. Yet, despite its growing importance for environmental sensing as well as the advance of joint communication and sensing for prospective WiFi and 6G standards, a dataset that integrates these modalities with radio frequency data (radar and RFID) remains rare. We introduce RF-Behavior, a multimodal radio frequency dataset for comprehensive human behavior and emotion analysis. We collected data from 44 participants performing 21 gestures, 10 activities, and 6 sentiment expressions. Data were captured using synchronized sensors, including 13 radars (8 ground-mounted and 5 ceiling-mounted), 6 to 8 RFID tags (attached to each arm) and LoRa. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) and 24 infrared cameras are used to provide precise motion ground truth. RF-Behavior provides a unified multimodal dataset spanning the full spectrum of human behavior -- from brief gestures to activities and emotional states -- enabling research on multi-task learning across motion and emotion recognition. Benchmark results demonstrate that the strategic sensor placement is complementary across modalities, with distinct performance characteristics across different behavioral categories.","['Si Zuo', 'Yuqing Song', 'Sahar Golipoor', 'Ying Liu', 'Xujun Ma', 'Stephan Sigg']",2025-11-08 14:21:17+00:00,cs.DB,2511.06020v1,1317
An Efficient Proximity Graph-based Approach to Table Union Search,"Neural embedding models are extensively employed in the table union search problem, which aims to find semantically compatible tables that can be merged with a given query table. In particular, multi-vector models, which represent a table as a vector set (typically one vector per column), have been demonstrated to achieve superior retrieval quality by capturing fine-grained semantic alignments. However, this problem faces more severe efficiency challenges than the single-vector problem due to the inherent dependency on bipartite graph maximum matching to compute unionability scores. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient Proximity Graph-based Table Union Search (PGTUS) approach. PGTUS employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines a novel refinement strategy, a filtering strategy based on many-to-one bipartite matching. Besides, we propose an enhanced pruning strategy to prune the candidate set, which further improve the search efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves 3.6-6.0X speedup over existing approaches while maintaining comparable recall rates.","['Yiming Xie', 'Hua Dai', 'Mingfeng Jiang', 'Pengyue Li', 'zhengkai Zhang', 'Bohan Li']",2025-11-07 08:55:39+00:00,cs.DB,2511.05082v1,1128
Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis,"Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a feature of cooperative interaction where users are intentional about the degree to which they specify queries. We develop a principled framework based on a shared responsibility of query specification between user and system, distinguishing unambiguous and ambiguous cooperative queries, which systems can resolve through reasonable inference, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved. Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. This conceptualization around cooperation in resolving queries informs how to design and evaluate natural language interfaces for tabular data analysis, for which we distill concrete directions for future research and broader implications.","['Daniel Gomm', 'Cornelius Wolff', 'Madelon Hulsebos']",2025-11-06 17:39:18+00:00,cs.AI,2511.04584v3,1080
RUST-BENCH: Benchmarking LLM Reasoning on Unstructured Text within Structured Tables,"Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research.","['Nikhil Abhyankar', 'Purvi Chaurasia', 'Sanchit Kabra', 'Ananya Srivastava', 'Vivek Gupta', 'Chandan K.

Coordination-Free Lane Partitioning for Convergent ANN Search,"Production vector search systems often fan out each query across parallel lanes (threads, replicas, or shards) to meet latency service-level objectives (SLOs). In practice, these lanes rediscover the same candidates, so extra compute does not increase coverage. We present a coordination-free lane partitioner that turns duplication into complementary work at the same cost and deadline. For each query we (1) build a deterministic candidate pool sized to the total top-k budget, (2) apply a per-query pseudorandom permutation, and (3) assign each lane a disjoint slice of positions. Lanes then return different results by construction, with no runtime coordination.
  At equal cost with four lanes (total candidate budget 64), on SIFT1M (1M SIFT feature vectors) with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW) recall@10 rises from 0.249 to 0.999 while lane overlap falls from nearly 100% to 0%. On MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with HNSW, hit@10 improves from 0.200 to 0.601 and Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) from 0.133 to 0.330. For inverted file (IVF) indexes we see smaller but consistent gains (for example, +11% on MS MARCO) by de-duplicating list routing. A microbenchmark shows planner overhead of ~37 microseconds per query (mean at the main setting) with linear growth in the number of merged candidates.
  These results yield a simple operational guideline: size the per-query pool to the total budget, deterministically partition positions across lanes, and turn redundant fan-out into complementary coverage without changing budget or deadline.","['Carl Kugblenu', 'Petri Vuorimaa']",2025-11-06 09:36:18+00:00,cs.IR,2511.04221v1,1565
"BAPPA: Benchmarking Agents, Plans, and Pipelines for Automated Text-to-SQL Generation","Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller, efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3) Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion.

EntroGD: Efficient Compression and Accurate Direct Analytics on Compressed Data,"Generalized Deduplication (GD) enables lossless compression with direct analytics on compressed data by dividing data into \emph{bases} and \emph{deviations} and performing dictionary encoding on the former. However, GD algorithms face scalability challenges for high-dimensional data. For example, the GreedyGD algorithm relies on an iterative bit-selection process across $d$-dimensional data resulting in $O(nd^2)$ complexity for $n$ data rows to select bits to be used as bases and deviations. Although the $n$ data rows can be reduced during training at the expense of performance, highly dimensional data still experiences a marked loss in performance. This paper introduces EntroGD, an entropy-guided GD framework that reduces complexity of the bit-selection algorithm to $O(nd)$. EntroGD operates considers a two-step process. First, it generates condensed samples to preserve analytic fidelity. Second, it applies entropy-guided bit selection to maximize compression efficiency. Across 18 datasets of varying types and dimensionalities, EntroGD achieves compression performance comparable to GD-based and universal compressors, while reducing configuration time by up to 53.5$\times$ over GreedyGD and accelerating clustering by up to 31.6$\times$ over the original data with negligible accuracy loss by performing analytics on the condensed samples, which are much fewer than original samples. Thus, EntroGD provides an efficient and scalable solution to performing analytics directly on compressed data.","['Xiaobo Zhao', 'Daniel E. Lucani']",2025-11-06 07:54:46+00:00,cs.DB,2511.04148v1,1514
A High-Throughput GPU Framework for Adaptive Lossless Compression of Floating-Point Data,"The torrential influx of floating-point data from domains like IoT and HPC necessitates high-performance lossless compression to mitigate storage costs while preserving absolute data fidelity. Leveraging GPU parallelism for this task presents significant challenges, including bottlenecks in heterogeneous data movement, complexities in executing precision-preserving conversions, and performance degradation due to anomaly-induced sparsity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel GPU-based framework for floating-point adaptive lossless compression. The proposed solution employs three key innovations: a lightweight asynchronous pipeline that effectively hides I/O latency during CPU-GPU data transfer; a fast and theoretically guaranteed float-to-integer conversion method that eliminates errors inherent in floating-point arithmetic; and an adaptive sparse bit-plane encoding strategy that mitigates the sparsity caused by outliers. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, achieving an average compression ratio of 0.299 (a 9.1% relative improvement over the best competitor), an average compression throughput of 10.82 GB/s (2.4x higher), and an average decompression throughput of 12.32 GB/s (2.4x higher).","['Zheng Li', 'Weiyan Wang', 'Ruiyuan Li', 'Chao Chen', 'Xianlei Long', 'Linjiang Zheng', 'Quanqing Xu', 'Chuanhui Yang']",2025-11-06 07:37:53+00:00,cs.DB,2511.04140v2,1333
Learning Filter-Aware Distance Metrics for Nearest Neighbor Search with Multiple Filters,"Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im- proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.","['Ananya Sutradhar', 'Suryansh Gupta', 'Ravishankar Krishnaswamy', 'Haiyang Xu', 'Aseem Rastogi', 'Gopal Srinivasa']",2025-11-06 05:24:41+00:00,cs.LG,2511.04073v1,1368
Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition,"Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample size.","['Hlali Azzeddine', 'Majid Ben Yakhlef', 'Soulaiman El Hazzat']",2025-11-05 22:34:06+00:00,cs.CV,2511.03891v2,1693
Analytical Queries for Unstructured Data,"Unstructured data, in the form of text, images, video, and audio, is produced at exponentially higher rates. In tandem, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly powerful at analyzing unstructured data. Modern ML methods can now detect objects in images, understand actions in videos, and even classify complex legal texts based on legal intent. Combined, these trends make it increasingly feasible for analysts and researchers to automatically understand the ""real world."" However, there are major challenges in deploying these techniques: 1) executing queries efficiently given the expense of ML methods, 2) expressing queries over bespoke forms of data, and 3) handling errors in ML methods.
  In this monograph, we discuss challenges and advances in data management systems for unstructured data using ML, with a particular focus on video analytics. Using ML to answer queries introduces new challenges.First, even turning user intent into queries can be challenging: it is not obvious how to express a query of the form ""select instances of cars turning left."" Second, ML models can be orders of magnitude more expensive compared to processing traditional structured data. Third, ML models and the methods to accelerate analytics with ML models can be error-prone.
  Recent work in the data management community has aimed to address all of these challenges. Users can now express queries via user-defined functions, opaquely through standard structured schemas, and even by providing examples. Given a query, recent work focuses on optimizing queries by approximating expensive ""gold"" methods with varying levels of guarantees. Finally, to handle errors in ML models, recent work has focused on applying outlier and drift detection to data analytics with ML.",['Daniel Kang'],2025-11-05 14:15:59+00:00,cs.DB,2511.03489v1,1776
In-Memory Indexing and Querying of Provenance in Data Preparation Pipelines,"Data provenance has numerous applications in the context of data preparation pipelines. It can be used for debugging faulty pipelines, interpreting results, verifying fairness, and identifying data quality issues, which may affect the sources feeding the pipeline execution.

Our solution leverages tensors to capture fine-grained provenance of data processing operations, using minimal memory. In addition to record-level lineage relationships, we provide finer granularity at the attribute level. This is achieved by augmenting tensors, which capture retrospective provenance, with prospective provenance information, drawing connections between input and output schemas of data processing operations. We demonstrate how these two types of provenance (retrospective and prospective) can be combined to answer a broad range of provenance queries efficiently, and show effectiveness through evaluation exercises using both real and synthetic data.","['Khalid Belhajjame', 'Haroun Mezrioui', 'Yuyan Zhao']",2025-11-05 14:05:07+00:00,cs.DB,2511.03480v1,1048
HERP: Hardware for Energy Efficient and Realtime DB Search and Cluster Expansion in Proteomics,"Database (DB) search and clustering are fundamental in proteomics but conventional full clustering and search approaches demand high resources and incur long latency. We propose a lightweight incremental clustering and highly parallelizable DB search platform tailored for resource-constrained environments, delivering low energy and latency without compromising performance. By leveraging mass-spectrometry insights, we employ bucket-wise parallelization and query scheduling to reduce latency. A one-time hardware initialization with pre-clustered proteomics data enables continuous DB search and local re-clustering, offering a more practical and efficient alternative to clustering from scratch. Heuristics from pre-clustered data guide incremental clustering, accelerating the process by 20x with only a 0.3% increase in clustering error. DB search results overlap by 96% with state-of-the-art tools, validating search quality. The hardware leverages a 3T 2M T J SOT-CAM at the 7nm node with a compute-in-memory design. For the human genome draft dataset (131GB), setup requires 1.19mJ for 2M spectra, while a 1000 query search consumes 1.1μJ. Bucket-wise parallelization further achieves 100x speedup.","['Md Mizanur Rahaman Nayan', 'Zheyu Li', 'Flavio Ponzina', 'Sumukh Pinge', 'Tajana Rosing', 'Azad J.

Formalizing ETLT and ELTL Design Patterns and Proposing Enhanced Variants: A Systematic Framework for Modern Data Engineering,"Traditional ETL and ELT design patterns struggle to meet modern requirements of scalability, governance, and real-time data processing. Hybrid approaches such as ETLT (Extract-Transform-Load-Transform) and ELTL (Extract-Load-Transform-Load) are already used in practice, but the literature lacks best practices and formal recognition of these approaches as design patterns. This paper formalizes ETLT and ELTL as reusable design patterns by codifying implicit best practices and introduces enhanced variants, ETLT++ and ELTL++, to address persistent gaps in governance, quality assurance, and observability. We define ETLT and ELTL patterns systematically within a design pattern framework, outlining their structure, trade-offs, and use cases. Building on this foundation, we extend them into ETLT++ and ELTL++ by embedding explicit contracts, versioning, semantic curation, and continuous monitoring as mandatory design obligations. The proposed framework offers practitioners a structured roadmap to build auditable, scalable, and cost-efficient pipelines, unifying quality enforcement, lineage, and usability across multi-cloud and real-time contexts. By formalizing ETLT and ELTL, and enhancing them through ETLT++ and ELTL++, this work bridges the gap between ad hoc practice and systematic design, providing a reusable foundation for modern, trustworthy data engineering.","['Chiara Rucco', 'Motaz Saad', 'Antonella Longo']",2025-11-05 11:54:22+00:00,cs.DB,2511.03393v1,1378
OptiMA: A Transaction-Based Framework with Throughput Optimization for Very Complex Multi-Agent Systems,"In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity; susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools that can be used for future research on it.","['Umut Çalıkyılmaz', 'Nitin Nayak', 'Jinghua Groppe', 'Sven Groppe']",2025-11-05 10:23:24+00:00,cs.MA,2511.03761v1,961
Relational Deep Dive: Error-Aware Queries Over Unstructured Data,"Unstructured data is pervasive, but analytical queries demand structured representations, creating a significant extraction challenge. Existing methods like RAG lack schema awareness and struggle with cross-document alignment, leading to high error rates. We propose ReDD (Relational Deep Dive), a framework that dynamically discovers query-specific schemas, populates relational tables, and ensures error-aware extraction with provable guarantees. ReDD features a two-stage pipeline: (1) Iterative Schema Discovery (ISD) identifies minimal, joinable schemas tailored to each query, and (2) Tabular Data Population (TDP) extracts and corrects data using lightweight classifiers trained on LLM hidden states. A main contribution of ReDD is SCAPE, a statistically calibrated method for error detection with coverage guarantees, and SCAPE-HYB, a hybrid approach that optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and human correction costs. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate ReDD's effectiveness, reducing data extraction errors from up to 30% to below 1% while maintaining high schema completeness (100% recall) and precision. ReDD's modular design enables fine-grained control over accuracy-cost trade-offs, making it a robust solution for high-stakes analytical queries over unstructured corpora.","['Daren Chao', 'Kaiwen Chen', 'Naiqing Guan', 'Nick Koudas']",2025-11-04 16:30:55+00:00,cs.DB,2511.02711v1,1305
EasyTUS: A Comprehensive Framework for Fast and Accurate Table Union Search across Data Lakes,"Data lakes enable easy maintenance of heterogeneous data in its native form. While this flexibility can accelerate data ingestion, it shifts the complexity of data preparation and query processing to data discovery tasks. One such task is Table Union Search (TUS), which identifies tables that can be unioned with a given input table. In this work, we present EasyTUS, a comprehensive framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform efficient and scalable Table Union Search across data lakes. EasyTUS implements the search pipeline as three modular steps: Table Serialization for consistent formatting and sampling, Table Representation that utilizes LLMs to generate embeddings, and Vector Search that leverages approximate nearest neighbor indexing for semantic matching. To enable reproducible and systematic evaluation, in this paper, we also introduce TUSBench, a novel standardized benchmarking environment within the EasyTUS framework. TUSBench supports unified comparisons across approaches and data lakes, promoting transparency and progress in the field. Our experiments using TUSBench show that EasyTUS consistently outperforms most of the state-of the-art approaches, achieving improvements in average of up to 34.3% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), up to 79.2x speedup in data preparation, and up to 7.7x faster query processing performance. Furthermore, EasyTUS maintains strong performance even in metadata-absent settings, highlighting its robustness and adaptability across data lakes.",['Tim Otto'],2025-11-04 15:54:33+00:00,cs.DB,2511.02674v1,1520
AgriTrust: a Federated Semantic Governance Framework for Trusted Agricultural Data Sharing,"The potential of agricultural data (AgData) to drive efficiency and sustainability is stifled by the ""AgData Paradox"": a pervasive lack of trust and interoperability that locks data in silos, despite its recognized value. This paper introduces AgriTrust, a federated semantic governance framework designed to resolve this paradox. AgriTrust integrates a multi-stakeholder governance model, built on pillars of Data Sovereignty, Transparent Data Contracts, Equitable Value Sharing, and Regulatory Compliance, with a semantic digital layer. This layer is realized through the AgriTrust Core Ontology, a formal OWL ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for tokenization, traceability, and certification, enabling true semantic interoperability across independent platforms. A key innovation is a blockchain-agnostic, multi-provider architecture that prevents vendor lock-in. The framework's viability is demonstrated through case studies across three critical Brazilian supply chains: coffee (for EUDR compliance), soy (for mass balance), and beef (for animal tracking). The results show that AgriTrust successfully enables verifiable provenance, automates compliance, and creates new revenue streams for data producers, thereby transforming data sharing from a trust-based dilemma into a governed, automated operation. This work provides a foundational blueprint for a more transparent, efficient, and equitable agricultural data economy.",['Ivan Bergier'],2025-11-04 15:20:13+00:00,cs.CY,2511.05572v1,1441
Accelerating Graph Similarity Search through Integer Linear Programming,"The Graph Edit Distance (GED) is an important metric for measuring the similarity between two (labeled) graphs. It is defined as the minimum cost required to convert one graph into another through a series of (elementary) edit operations. Its effectiveness in assessing the similarity of large graphs is limited by the complexity of its exact calculation, which is NP-hard theoretically and computationally challenging in practice. The latter can be mitigated by switching to the Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints, which determines whether the edit distance between two graphs is below a given threshold. A popular framework for solving Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints in a graph database for a query graph is the filter-and-verification framework. Filtering discards unpromising graphs, while the verification step certifies the similarity between the filtered graphs and the query graph. To improve the filtering step, we define a lower bound based on an integer linear programming formulation. We prove that this lower bound dominates the effective branch match-based lower bound and can also be computed efficiently. Consequently, we propose a graph similarity search algorithm that uses a hierarchy of lower bound algorithms and solves a novel integer programming formulation that exploits the threshold parameter. An extensive computational experience on a well-assessed test bed shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on most of the examined thresholds.","[""Andrea D'Ascenzo"", 'Julian Meffert', 'Petra Mutzel', 'Fabrizio Rossi']",2025-11-04 14:35:22+00:00,cs.DB,2511.02611v1,1528
Numbering Combinations for Compact Representation of Many-to-Many Relationship Sets,"In this paper we propose an approach to implement specific relation-ship set between two entities called combinatorial relationship set. For the combinatorial relationship set B between entity sets G and I the mapping cardinality is many-to-many. Additionally, entities from G can be uniquely encoded with a pair of values (h, k) generated with the procedure for numbering combinations of entities from I. The encoding procedure is based on combinatorial number system that provides a representation of all possible k -combinations of a set of n elements by a single number. In general many-to-many relationship sets are represented by a relation or table, while the combinatorial relationship is not physically stored as separate table. However, all information is encapsulated into a single column added to G. The new column is a candidate key in G. Additional operation named Rank-Join to fundamental relational-algebra is presented to combine information from g and i associated with a combinatorial relationship set. Motivation for combinatorial relationship originates from challenges in designing and implementing multivalued dimensions and bridge tables in data-warehouse models.",['Savo Tomovic'],2025-11-03 22:10:20+00:00,cs.DB,2511.02096v1,1187
Vortex: Hosting ML Inference and Knowledge Retrieval Services With Tight Latency and Throughput Requirements,"There is growing interest in deploying ML inference and knowledge retrieval as services that could support both interactive queries by end users and more demanding request flows that arise from AIs integrated into a end-user applications and deployed as agents. Our central premise is that these latter cases will bring service level latency objectives (SLOs). Existing ML serving platforms use batching to optimize for high throughput, exposing them to unpredictable tail latencies. Vortex enables an SLO-first approach. For identical tasks, Vortex's pipelines achieve significantly lower and more stable latencies than TorchServe and Ray Serve over a wide range of workloads, often enabling a given SLO target at more than twice the request rate. When RDMA is available, the Vortex advantage is even more significant.","['Yuting Yang', 'Tiancheng Yuan', 'Jamal Hashim', 'Thiago Garrett', 'Jeffrey Qian', 'Ann Zhang', 'Yifan Wang', 'Weijia Song', 'Ken Birman']",2025-11-03 20:59:27+00:00,cs.DB,2511.02062v1,819
InteracSPARQL: An Interactive System for SPARQL Query Refinement Using Natural Language Explanations,"In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remained challenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complex syntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. To address these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query generation and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations (NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement. InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce structured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs), followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine queries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the correction of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate InteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in query accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to baseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of combining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more accessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.","['Xiangru Jian', 'Zhengyuan Dong', 'M.

LARK -- Linearizability Algorithms for Replicated Keys in Aerospike,"We present LARK (Linearizability Algorithms for Replicated Keys), a synchronous replication protocol that achieves linearizability while minimizing latency and infrastructure cost, at significantly higher availability than traditional quorum-log consensus. LARK introduces Partition Availability Conditions (PAC) that reason over the entire database cluster rather than fixed replica sets, improving partition availability under independent failures by roughly 3x when tolerating one failure and 10x when tolerating two. Unlike Raft, Paxos, and Viewstamped Replication, LARK eliminates ordered logs, enabling immediate partition readiness after leader changes -- with at most a per-key duplicate-resolution round trip when the new leader lacks the latest copy. Under equal storage budgets -- where both systems maintain only f+1 data copies to tolerate f failures -- LARK continues committing through data-node failures while log-based protocols must pause commits for replica rebuilding. These properties also enable zero-downtime rolling restarts even when maintaining only two copies. We provide formal safety arguments and a TLA+ specification, and we demonstrate through analysis and experiments that LARK achieves significant availability gains.","['Andrew Goodng', 'Kevin Porter', 'Thomas Lopatic', 'Ashish Shinde', 'Sunil Sayyaparaju', 'Srinivasan Seshadri', 'V.

SemBench: A Benchmark for Semantic Query Processing Engines,"We present a benchmark targeting a novel class of systems: semantic query processing engines. Those systems rely inherently on generative and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators, configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multimodal data.
  Our benchmark introduces diversity across three key dimensions: scenarios, modalities, and operators. Included are scenarios ranging from movie review analysis to medical question-answering. Within these scenarios, we cover different data modalities, including images, audio, and text. Finally, the queries involve a diverse set of operators, including semantic filters, joins, mappings, ranking, and classification operators.

UniDataBench: Evaluating Data Analytics Agents Across Structured and Unstructured Data,"In the real business world, data is stored in a variety of sources, including structured relational databases, unstructured databases (e.g., NoSQL databases), or even CSV/excel files. The ability to extract reasonable insights across these diverse source is vital for business success. Existing benchmarks, however, are limited in assessing agents' capabilities across these diverse data types. To address this gap, we introduce UniDataBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of data analytics agents in handling diverse data sources. Specifically, UniDataBench is originating from real-life industry analysis report and we then propose a pipeline to remove the privacy and sensitive information. It encompasses a wide array of datasets, including relational databases, CSV files to NoSQL data, reflecting real-world business scenarios, and provides unified framework to assess how effectively agents can explore multiple data formats, extract valuable insights, and generate meaningful summaries and recommendations. Based on UniDataBench, we propose a novel LLM-based agent named ReActInsight, an autonomous agent that performs end-to-end analysis over diverse data sources by automatically discovering cross-source linkages, decomposing goals, and generating robust, self-correcting code to extract actionable insights. Our benchmark and agent together provide a powerful framework for advancing the capabilities of data analytics agents in real-world applications.","['Han Weng', 'Zhou Liu', 'Yuanfeng Song', 'Xiaoming Yin', 'Xing Chen', 'Wentao Zhang']",2025-11-03 14:36:26+00:00,cs.DB,2511.01625v1,1498
L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3,"Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance.
  To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm.
  We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.","['Xinyue Yang', 'Chen Zheng', 'Yaoyang Hou', 'Renhao Zhang', 'Yinyan Zhang', 'Yanjun Wu', 'Heng Zhang']",2025-11-03 14:04:22+00:00,cs.DB,2511.01602v3,1612
Subtree Mode and Applications,"The mode of a collection of values (i.e., the most frequent value in the collection) is a key summary statistic. Finding the mode in a given range of an array of values is thus of great importance, and constructing a data structure to solve this problem is in fact the well-known Range Mode problem. In this work, we introduce the Subtree Mode (SM) problem, the analogous problem in a leaf-colored tree, where the task is to compute the most frequent color in the leaves of the subtree of a given node. SM is motivated by several applications in domains such as text analytics and biology, where the data are hierarchical and can thus be represented as a (leaf-colored) tree. Our central contribution is a time-optimal algorithm for SM that computes the answer for every node of an input $N$-node tree in $O(N)$ time. We further show how our solution can be adapted for node-colored trees, or for computing the $k$ most frequent colors, in the optimal $O(N)$ time, for any given $k=O(1)$. Moreover, we prove that a similarly fast solution for when the input is a sink-colored directed acyclic graph instead of a leaf-colored tree is highly unlikely. Our experiments on real datasets with trees of up to 7.3 billion nodes demonstrate that our algorithm is faster than baselines by at least one order of magnitude and much more space efficient. Last, we present case studies showing the effectiveness of our approach in pattern mining and sequence-to-database search applications.","['Jialong Zhou', 'Ben Bals', 'Matei Tinca', 'Ai Guan', 'Panagiotis Charalampopoulos', 'Grigorios Loukides', 'Solon P.

Towards Defect Phase Diagrams: From Research Data Management to Automated Workflows,"Defect phase diagrams provide a unified description of crystal defect states for materials design and are central to the scientific objectives of the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1394. Their construction requires the systematic integration of heterogeneous experimental and simulation data across research groups and locations. In this setting, research data management (RDM) is a key enabler of new scientific insight by linking distributed research activities and making complex data reproducible and reusable.
  To address the challenge of heterogeneous data sources and formats, a comprehensive RDM infrastructure has been established that links experiment, data, and analysis in a seamless workflow. The system combines: (1) a joint electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, (2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed research data.

Fast Answering Pattern-Constrained Reachability Queries with Two-Dimensional Reachability Index,"Reachability queries ask whether there exists a path from the source vertex to the target vertex on a graph. Recently, several powerful reachability queries, such as Label-Constrained Reachability (LCR) queries and Regular Path Queries (RPQ), have been proposed for emerging complex edge-labeled digraphs. However, they cannot allow users to describe complex query requirements by composing query patterns. Here, we introduce composite patterns, a logical expression of patterns that can express complex constraints on the set of labels. Based on pattern, we propose pattern-constrained reachability queries (PCR queries). However, answering PCR queries is NP-hard. Thus, to improve the performance to answer PCR queries, we build a two-dimensional reachability (TDR for short) index which consists of a multi-way index (horizontal dimension) and a path index (vertical dimension). Because the number of combinations of both labels and vertices is exponential, it is very expensive to build full indices that contain all the reachability information. Thus, the reachable vertices of a vertex are decomposed into blocks, each of which is hashed into the horizontal dimension index and the vertical dimension index, respectively. The indices in the horizontal dimension and the vertical dimension serve as a global filter and a local filter, respectively, to prune the search space. Experimental results demonstrate that our index size and indexing time outperform the state-of-the-art label-constrained reachability indexing technique on 16 real datasets. TDR can efficiently answer pattern-constrained reachability queries, including label-constrained reachability queries.","['Huihui Yang', 'Pingpeng Yuan']",2025-11-02 17:43:07+00:00,cs.DB,2511.01025v1,1673
PathFinder: Efficiently Supporting Conjunctions and Disjunctions for Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search,"Filtered approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) restricts the search to data objects whose attributes satisfy a given filter and retrieves the top-$K$ objects that are most semantically similar to the query object. Many graph-based ANNS indexes are proposed to enable efficient filtered ANNS but remain limited in applicability or performance: indexes optimized for a specific attribute achieve high efficiency for filters on that attribute but fail to support complex filters with arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions over multiple attributes. Inspired by the design of relational databases, this paper presents PathFinder, a new indexing framework that allows users to selectively create ANNS indexes optimized for filters on specific attributes and employs a cost-based optimizer to efficiently utilize them for processing complex filters. PathFinder includes three novel techniques: 1) a new optimization metric that captures the tradeoff between query execution time and accuracy, 2) a two-phase optimization for handling filters with conjunctions and disjunctions, and 3) an index borrowing optimization that uses an attribute-specific index to process filters on another attribute. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that PathFinder outperforms the best baseline by up to 9.8x in query throughput at recall 0.95.","['Tianming Wu', 'Dixin Tang']",2025-11-02 16:06:38+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00995v1,1336
ORANGE: An Online Reflection ANd GEneration framework with Domain Knowledge for Text-to-SQL,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in translating natural language to SQL, but a significant semantic gap persists between their general knowledge and domain-specific semantics of databases. Historical translation logs constitute a rich source of this missing in-domain knowledge, where SQL queries inherently encapsulate real-world usage patterns of database schema. Existing methods primarily enhance the reasoning process for individual translations but fail to accumulate in-domain knowledge from past translations. We introduce ORANGE, an online self-evolutionary framework that constructs database-specific knowledge bases by parsing SQL queries from translation logs. By accumulating in-domain knowledge that contains schema and data semantics, ORANGE progressively reduces the semantic gap and enhances the accuracy of subsequent SQL translations. To ensure reliability, we propose a novel nested Chain-of-Thought SQL-to-Text strategy with tuple-semantic tracking, which reduces semantic errors during knowledge generation. Experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm the practicality of ORANGE, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world Text-to-SQL deployment, particularly in handling complex and domain-specific queries.","['Yiwen Jiao', 'Tonghui Ren', 'Yuche Gao', 'Zhenying He', 'Yinan Jing', 'Kai Zhang', 'X.

FlowLog: Efficient and Extensible Datalog via Incrementality,"Datalog-based languages are regaining popularity as a powerful abstraction for expressing recursive computations in domains such as program analysis and graph processing. However, existing systems often face a trade-off between efficiency and extensibility. Engines like Souffle achieve high efficiency through domain-specific designs, but lack general-purpose flexibility. Others, like RecStep, offer modularity by layering Datalog on traditional databases, but struggle to integrate Datalog-specific optimizations.
  This paper bridges this gap by presenting FlowLog, a new Datalog engine that uses an explicit relational IR per-rule to cleanly separate recursive control (e.g., semi-naive execution) from each rule's logical plan. This boundary lets us retain fine-grained, Datalog-aware optimizations at the logical layer, but also reuse off-the-shelf database primitives at execution. At the logical level (i.e. IR), we apply proven SQL optimizations, such as logic fusion and subplan reuse. To address high volatility in recursive workloads, we adopt a robustness-first approach that pairs a structural optimizer (avoiding worst-case joins) with sideways information passing (early filtering). Built atop Differential Dataflow--a mature framework for streaming analytics--FlowLog supports both batch and incremental Datalog and adds novel recursion-aware optimizations called Boolean (or algebraic) specialization. Our evaluation shows that FlowLog outperforms state-of-the-art Datalog engines and modern databases across a broad range of recursive workloads, achieving superior scalability while preserving a simple and extensible architecture.","['Hangdong Zhao', 'Zhenghong Yu', 'Srinag Rao', 'Simon Frisk', 'Zhiwei Fan', 'Paraschos Koutris']",2025-11-02 09:11:17+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00865v4,1651
All-in-one Graph-based Indexing for Hybrid Search on GPUs,"Hybrid search has emerged as a promising paradigm to overcome the limitations of single-path retrieval, enhancing accuracy for applications like recommendations, information retrieval, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. However, existing methods are constrained by a trilemma: they sacrifice flexibility for efficiency, suffer from accuracy degradation due to separate retrievals, or incur prohibitive storage overhead for flexible combinations of retrieval paths. This paper introduces Allan-Poe, a novel All-in-one graph index accelerated by GPUs for efficient hybrid search. We first analyze the limitations of existing retrieval paradigms and distill key design principles for an effective hybrid search index. Guided by these principles, we architect a unified graph-based index that flexibly integrates four retrieval paths-dense vector, sparse vector, full-text, and knowledge graph-within a single, cohesive structure. To enable efficient construction, we design a GPU-accelerated pipeline featuring a warp-level hybrid distance kernel, RNG-IP joint pruning, and keyword-aware neighbor recycling. For query processing, we introduce a dynamic fusion framework that supports any combination of retrieval paths and weights without index reconstruction, leveraging logical edges from the knowledge graph to resolve complex multi-hop queries. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world datasets demonstrate that Allan-Poe achieves superior end-to-end query accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 1.5-186.4x in throughput, while significantly reducing storage overhead.","['Zhonggen Li', 'Yougen Li', 'Yifan Zhu', 'Zhaoqiang Chen', 'Yunjun Gao']",2025-11-02 08:39:12+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00855v1,1581
Efficient Query Repair for Aggregate Constraints,"In many real-world scenarios, query results must satisfy domain-specific constraints. For instance, a minimum percentage of interview candidates selected based on their qualifications should be female. These requirements can be expressed as constraints over an arithmetic combination of aggregates evaluated on the result of the query. In this work, we study how to repair a query to fulfill such constraints by modifying the filter predicates of the query. We introduce a novel query repair technique that leverages bounds on sets of candidate solutions and interval arithmetic to efficiently prune the search space. We demonstrate experimentally, that our technique significantly outperforms baselines that consider a single candidate at a time.","['Shatha Algarni', 'Boris Glavic', 'Seokki Lee', 'Adriane Chapman']",2025-11-02 06:36:19+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00826v1,747
Reliable Curation of EHR Dataset via Large Language Models under Environmental Constraints,"Electronic health records (EHRs) are central to modern healthcare delivery and research; yet, many researchers lack the database expertise necessary to write complex SQL queries or generate effective visualizations, limiting efficient data use and scientific discovery. To address this barrier, we introduce CELEC, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework for automated EHR data extraction and analytics. CELEC translates natural language queries into SQL using a prompting strategy that integrates schema information, few-shot demonstrations, and chain-of-thought reasoning, which together improve accuracy and robustness. On a subset of the EHRSQL benchmark, CELEC achieves execution accuracy comparable to prior systems while maintaining low latency, cost efficiency, and strict privacy by exposing only database metadata to the LLM. CELEC also adheres to strict privacy protocols: the LLM accesses only database metadata (e.g., table and column names), while all query execution occurs securely within the institutional environment, ensuring that no patient-level data is ever transmitted to or shared with the LLM. Ablation studies confirm that each component of the SQL generation pipeline, particularly the few-shot demonstrations, plays a critical role in performance. By lowering technical barriers and enabling medical researchers to query EHR databases directly, CELEC streamlines research workflows and accelerates biomedical discovery.","['Raymond M.

Finding Non-Redundant Simpson's Paradox from Multidimensional Data,"Simpson's paradox, a long-standing statistical phenomenon, describes the reversal of an observed association when data are disaggregated into sub-populations. It has critical implications across statistics, epidemiology, economics, and causal inference. Existing methods for detecting Simpson's paradox overlook a key issue: many paradoxes are redundant, arising from equivalent selections of data subsets, identical partitioning of sub-populations, and correlated outcome variables, which obscure essential patterns and inflate computational cost. In this paper, we present the first framework for discovering non-redundant Simpson's paradoxes. We formalize three types of redundancy - sibling child, separator, and statistic equivalence - and show that redundancy forms an equivalence relation. Leveraging this insight, we propose a concise representation framework for systematically organizing redundant paradoxes and design efficient algorithms that integrate depth-first materialization of the base table with redundancy-aware paradox discovery. Experiments on real-world datasets and synthetic benchmarks show that redundant paradoxes are widespread, on some real datasets constituting over 40% of all paradoxes, while our algorithms scale to millions of records, reduce run time by up to 60%, and discover paradoxes that are structurally robust under data perturbation. These results demonstrate that Simpson's paradoxes can be efficiently identified, concisely summarized, and meaningfully interpreted in large multidimensional datasets.","['Yi Yang', 'Jian Pei', 'Jun Yang', 'Jichun Xie']",2025-11-02 00:28:36+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00748v1,1546
Object-Centric Analysis of XES Event Logs: Integrating OCED Modeling with SPARQL Queries,"Object Centric Event Data (OCED) has gained attention in recent years within the field of process mining. However, there are still many challenges, such as connecting the XES format to object-centric approaches to enable more insightful analysis. It is important for a process miner to understand the insights and dependencies of events in the event log to see what is going on in our processes. In previous standards, the dependencies of event logs are only used to show events, but not their dependencies among each other and actions in detail as described in OCEDO. There is more information in the event log when it is revealed using the OCEDO model. It becomes more understandable and easier to grasp the concepts and deal with the processes. This paper proposes the use of Object-Centric Event Data Ontology (OCEDO) to overcome the limitations of the XES standard in event logs for process mining. We demonstrate how the OCEDO approach, integrated with SPARQL queries, can be applied to the BPIC 2013 dataset to make the relationships between events and objects more explicit. It describes dealing with the meta descriptions of the OCEDO model on a business process challenge as an event log. It improves the completeness and readability of process data, suggesting that object-centric modeling allows for richer analyses than traditional approaches.","['Saba Latif', 'Huma Latif', 'Muhammad Rameez Ur Rahman']",2025-11-01 20:24:36+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00693v1,1356
Embedding based Encoding Scheme for Privacy Preserving Record Linkage,"To discover new insights from data, there is a growing need to share information that is often held by different organisations. One key task in data integration is the calculation of similarities between records in different databases to identify pairs or sets of records that correspond to the same real-world entities. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the owners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or share their data with other organisations to allow such similarity calculations. Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is the process of matching records that refer to the same entity across sensitive databases held by different organisations while ensuring no information about the entities is revealed to the participating parties. In this paper, we study how embedding based encoding techniques can be applied in the PPRL context to ensure the privacy of the entities that are being linked. We first convert individual q-grams into the embedded space and then convert the embedding of a set of q-grams of a given record into a binary representation. The final binary representations can be used to link records into matches and non-matches. We empirically evaluate our proposed encoding technique against different real-world datasets. The results suggest that our proposed encoding approach can provide better linkage accuracy and protect the privacy of individuals against attack compared to state-of-the-art techniques for short record values.","['Sirintra Vaiwsri', 'Thilina Ranbaduge']",2025-11-01 05:57:21+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00414v1,1509
NOMAD -- Navigating Optimal Model Application to Datastreams,"NOMAD (Navigating Optimal Model Application for Datastreams) is an intelligent framework for data enrichment during ingestion that optimizes realtime multiclass classification by dynamically constructing model chains, i.e ,sequences of machine learning models with varying cost-quality tradeoffs, selected via a utilitybased criterion. Inspired by predicate ordering techniques from database query processing, NOMAD leverages cheaper models as initial filters, proceeding to more expensive models only when necessary, while guaranteeing classification quality remains comparable to a designated role model through a formal chain safety mechanism. It employs a dynamic belief update strategy to adapt model selection based on per event predictions and shifting data distributions, and extends to scenarios with dependent models such as earlyexit DNNs and stacking ensembles. Evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that NOMAD achieves significant computational savings compared to static and naive approaches while maintaining classification quality comparable to that achieved by the most accurate (and often the most expensive) model.","['Ashwin Gerard Colaco', 'Sharad Mehrotra', 'Michael J De Lucia', 'Kevin Hamlen', 'Murat Kantarcioglu', 'Latifur Khan', 'Ananthram Swami', 'Bhavani Thuraisingham']",2025-10-31 22:17:50+00:00,cs.DB,2511.00290v2,1144
Rateless Bloom Filters: Set Reconciliation for Divergent Replicas with Variable-Sized Elements,"Set reconciliation protocols typically make two critical assumptions: they are designed for fixed-sized elements and they are optimized for when the difference cardinality, d, is very small. When adapting to variable-sized elements, the current practice is to synchronize fixed-size element digests. However, when the number of differences is considerable, such as after a network partition, this approach can be inefficient. Our solution is a two-stage hybrid protocol that introduces a preliminary Bloom filter step, specifically designed for this regime. The novelty of this approach, however, is in solving a core technical challenge: determining the optimal Bloom filter size without knowing d. Our solution is the Rateless Bloom Filter (RBF), a dynamic filter that naturally adapts to arbitrary symmetric differences, closely matching the communication complexity of an optimally configured static filter without requiring any prior parametrization. Our evaluation in sets of variable-sized elements shows that for Jaccard indices below 85%, our RBF-IBLT hybrid protocol reduces the total communication cost by up to over 20% compared to the state-of-the-art.","['Pedro Silva Gomes', 'Carlos Baquero']",2025-10-31 16:39:56+00:00,cs.DS,2510.27614v1,1165
Learned Static Function Data Structures,"We consider the task of constructing a data structure for associating a static set of keys with values, while allowing arbitrary output values for queries involving keys outside the set. Compared to hash tables, these so-called static function data structures do not need to store the key set and thus use significantly less memory. Several techniques are known, with compressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the value sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use machine learning to capture correlations between keys and values. For each key, a model predicts a probability distribution over the values, from which we derive a key-specific prefix code to compactly encode the true value. The resulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure. This design allows learned static functions to break the zero-order entropy barrier while still supporting point queries. Our experiments show substantial space savings: up to one order of magnitude on real data, and up to three orders of magnitude on synthetic data.","['Stefan Hermann', 'Hans-Peter Lehmann', 'Giorgio Vinciguerra', 'Stefan Walzer']",2025-10-31 16:09:53+00:00,cs.DS,2510.27588v1,1098
Approximate Diverse $k$-nearest Neighbor Search in Vector Database,"Approximate $k$-nearest neighbor search (A$k$-NNS) is a core operation in vector databases, underpinning applications such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and image retrieval. In these scenarios, users often prefer diverse result sets to minimize redundancy and enhance information value. However, existing greedy-based diverse methods frequently yield sub-optimal results, failing to adequately approximate the optimal similarity score under certain diversification level. Furthermore, there is a need for flexible algorithms that can adapt to varying user-defined result sizes and diversity requirements.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that seamlessly integrates result diversification into state-of-the-art (SOTA) A$k$-NNS methods. Our approach introduces a progressive search framework, consisting of iterative searching, diversification, and verification phases. Carefully designed diversification and verification steps enable our approach to efficiently approximate the optimal diverse result set according to user-specified diversification levels without additional indexing overhead.
  We evaluate our method on three million-scale benchmark datasets, LAION-art, Deep1M, and Txt2img, using latency, similarity, and recall as performance metrics across a range of $k$ values and diversification thresholds. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently retrieves near-optimal diverse results with minimal latency overhead, particularly under medium and high diversity settings.","['Jiachen Zhao', 'Xiao Yan', 'Eric Lo']",2025-10-31 07:18:25+00:00,cs.DB,2510.27243v1,1539
DRAMA: Unifying Data Retrieval and Analysis for Open-Domain Analytic Queries,"Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and inefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none of the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key capabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data collection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that answers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain data. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single pipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative of DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories of tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100 instances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have gained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of open-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following DRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by coordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs structured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on DRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/drama.","['Chuxuan Hu', 'Maxwell Yang', 'James Weiland', 'Yeji Lim', 'Suhas Palawala', 'Daniel Kang']",2025-10-31 07:00:21+00:00,cs.DB,2510.27238v1,1572
ShapleyPipe: Hierarchical Shapley Search for Data Preparation Pipeline Construction,"Automated data preparation pipeline construction is critical for machine learning success, yet existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations: they treat pipeline construction as black-box optimization without quantifying individual operator contributions, and they struggle with the combinatorial explosion of the search space ($N^M$ configurations for N operators and pipeline length M). We introduce ShapleyPipe, a principled framework that leverages game-theoretic Shapley values to systematically quantify each operator's marginal contribution while maintaining full interpretability. Our key innovation is a hierarchical decomposition that separates category-level structure search from operator-level refinement, reducing the search complexity from exponential to polynomial. To make Shapley computation tractable, we develop: (1) a Multi-Armed Bandit mechanism for intelligent category evaluation with provable convergence guarantees, and (2) Permutation Shapley values to correctly capture position-dependent operator interactions. Extensive evaluation on 18 diverse datasets demonstrates that ShapleyPipe achieves 98.1\% of high-budget baseline performance while using 24\% fewer evaluations, and outperforms the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method by 3.6\%. Beyond performance gains, ShapleyPipe provides interpretable operator valuations ($ρ$=0.933 correlation with empirical performance) that enable data-driven pipeline analysis and systematic operator library refinement.","['Jing Chang', 'Chang Liu', 'Jinbin Huang', 'Shuyuan Zheng', 'Rui Mao', 'Jianbin Qin']",2025-10-31 04:37:16+00:00,cs.DB,2510.27168v1,1507
Relation-Aware Bayesian Optimization of DBMS Configurations Guided by Affinity Scores,"Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters, limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover, to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics. RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO), which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.","['Sein Kwon', 'Seulgi Baek', 'Hyunseo Yang', 'Youngwan Jo', 'Sanghyun Park']",2025-10-31 03:46:42+00:00,cs.LG,2510.27145v1,1815
Compass: General Filtered Search across Vector and Structured Data,"The increasing prevalence of hybrid vector and relational data necessitates efficient, general support for queries that combine high-dimensional vector search with complex relational filtering. However, existing filtered search solutions are fundamentally limited by specialized indices, which restrict arbitrary filtering and hinder integration with general-purpose DBMSs. This work introduces \textsc{Compass}, a unified framework that enables general filtered search across vector and structured data without relying on new index designs. Compass leverages established index structures -- such as HNSW and IVF for vector attributes, and B+-trees for relational attributes -- implementing a principled cooperative query execution strategy that coordinates candidate generation and predicate evaluation across modalities. Uniquely, Compass maintains generality by allowing arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and range predicates, while ensuring robustness even with highly-selective or multi-attribute filters. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Compass consistently outperforms NaviX, the only existing performant general framework, across diverse hybrid query workloads. It also matches the query throughput of specialized single-attribute indices in their favorite settings with only a single attribute involved, all while maintaining full generality and DBMS compatibility. Overall, Compass offers a practical and robust solution for achieving truly general filtered search in vector database systems.","['Chunxiao Ye', 'Xiao Yan', 'Eric Lo']",2025-10-31 03:36:14+00:00,cs.DB,2510.27141v3,1527
Unstructured Data Analysis using LLMs: A Comprehensive Benchmark,"Nowadays, the explosion of unstructured data presents immense analytical value. Leveraging the remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in extracting attributes of structured tables from unstructured data, researchers are developing LLM-powered data systems for users to analyze unstructured documents as working with a database. These unstructured data analysis (UDA) systems differ significantly in all aspects, including query interfaces, query optimization strategies, and operator implementations, making it unclear which performs best in which scenario. Unfortunately, there does not exist a comprehensive benchmark that offers high-quality, large-volume, and diverse datasets as well as rich query workload to thoroughly evaluate such systems. To fill this gap, we present UDA-Bench, the first benchmark for unstructured data analysis that meets all the above requirements. Specifically, we organize a team with 30 graduate students that spends over in total 10,000 hours on curating 5 datasets from various domains and constructing a relational database view from these datasets by manual annotation. These relational databases can be used as ground truth to evaluate any of these UDA systems despite their differences in programming interfaces. Moreover, we design diverse queries to analyze the attributes defined in the database schema, covering different types of analytical operators with varying selectivities and complexities. We conduct in-depth analysis of the key building blocks of existing UDA systems: query interface, query optimization, operator design, and data processing. We run exhaustive experiments over the benchmark to fully evaluate these systems and different techniques w.r.t. the above building blocks.","['Qiyan Deng', 'Jianhui Li', 'Chengliang Chai', 'Jinqi Liu', 'Junzhi She', 'Kaisen Jin', 'Zhaoze Sun', 'Yuhao Deng', 'Jia Yuan', 'Ye Yuan', 'Guoren Wang', 'Lei Cao']",2025-10-31 02:42:58+00:00,cs.DB,2510.27119v1,1750
The Impact of Data Compression in Real-Time and Historical Data Acquisition Systems on the Accuracy of Analytical Solutions,"In industrial and IoT environments, massive amounts of real-time and historical process data are continuously generated and archived. With sensors and devices capturing every operational detail, the volume of time-series data has become a critical challenge for storage and processing systems. Efficient data management is essential to ensure scalability, cost-effectiveness, and timely analytics. To minimize storage expenses and optimize performance, data compression algorithms are frequently utilized in data historians and acquisition systems. However, compression comes with trade-offs that may compromise the accuracy and reliability of engineering analytics that depend on this compressed data. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for developing data strategies that support both operational efficiency and accurate, reliable analytics. This paper assesses the relation of common compression mechanisms used in real-time and historical data systems and the accuracy of analytical solutions, including statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning models. Through theoretical analysis, simulated signal compression, and empirical assessment, we illustrate that excessive compression can lose critical patterns, skew statistical measures, and diminish predictive accuracy. The study suggests optimum methods and best practices for striking a compromise between analytical integrity and compression efficiency.","['Reham Faqehi', 'Haya Alhuraib', 'Hamad Saiari', 'Zyad Bamigdad']",2025-10-30 17:43:42+00:00,cs.DB,2510.26868v1,1439
Green Resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems: Doctoral Dissertation,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.",['Diaeddin Rimawi'],2025-11-20 17:46:41+00:00,cs.SE,2511.16593v1,1906
Data Annotation Quality Problems in AI-Enabled Perception System Development,"Data annotation is essential but highly error-prone in the development of AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) for automated driving, and its quality directly influences model performance, safety, and reliability. However, the industry lacks empirical insights into how annotation errors emerge and spread across the multi-organisational automotive supply chain. This study addresses this gap through a multi-organisation case study involving six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA. By conceptualising annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, this study contributes to SE4AI by offering a shared vocabulary, diagnostic toolset, and actionable guidance for building trustworthy AI-enabled perception systems.","['Hina Saeeda', 'Tommy Johansson', 'Mazen Mohamad', 'Eric Knauss']",2025-11-20 14:30:51+00:00,cs.SE,2511.16410v1,1552
CorrectHDL: Agentic HDL Design with LLMs Leveraging High-Level Synthesis as Reference,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.","['Kangwei Xu', 'Grace Li Zhang', 'Ulf Schlichtmann', 'Bing Li']",2025-11-20 14:13:38+00:00,cs.AI,2511.16395v1,1488
An Agent-Based Framework for the Automatic Validation of Mathematical Optimization Models,"Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.","['Alexander Zadorojniy', 'Segev Wasserkrug', 'Eitan Farchi']",2025-11-20 14:03:07+00:00,cs.AI,2511.16383v1,1018
"Beyond Code Similarity: Benchmarking the Plausibility, Efficiency, and Complexity of LLM-Generated Smart Contracts","Smart Contracts are critical components of blockchain ecosystems, with Solidity as the dominant programming language. While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.","['Francesco Salzano', 'Simone Scalabrino', 'Rocco Oliveto', 'Simone Scalabrino']",2025-11-20 10:47:59+00:00,cs.SE,2511.16224v1,1590
Domain-constrained Synthesis of Inconsistent Key Aspects in Textual Vulnerability Descriptions,"Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) are crucial for security analysts to understand and address software vulnerabilities. However, the key aspect inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories pose challenges for achieving a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities. Existing approaches aim to mitigate inconsistencies by aligning TVDs with external knowledge bases, but they often discard valuable information and fail to synthesize comprehensive representations. In this paper, we propose a domain-constrained LLM-based synthesis framework for unifying key aspects of TVDs. Our framework consists of three stages: 1) Extraction, guided by rule-based templates to ensure all critical details are captured; 2) Self-evaluation, using domain-specific anchor words to assess semantic variability across sources; and 3) Fusion, leveraging information entropy to reconcile inconsistencies and prioritize relevant details. This framework improves synthesis performance, increasing the F1 score for key aspect augmentation from 0.82 to 0.87, while enhancing comprehension and efficiency by over 30\%. We further develop Digest Labels, a practical tool for visualizing TVDs, which human evaluations show significantly boosts usability.","['Linyi Han', 'Shidong Pan', 'Zhenchang Xing', 'Sofonias Yitagesu', 'Xiaowang Zhang', 'Zhiyong Feng', 'Jiamou Sun', 'Qing Huang']",2025-11-20 07:27:58+00:00,cs.SE,2511.16123v1,1244

InfCode-C++: Intent-Guided Semantic Retrieval and AST-Structured Search for C++ Issue Resolution,"Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution.

We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix. The framework runs inside a containerized environment that supports realistic repository inspection, modification, and validation.

RE for AI in Practice: Managing Data Annotation Requirements for AI Autonomous Driving Systems,"High-quality data annotation requirements are crucial for the development of safe and reliable AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) in autonomous driving. Although these requirements play a vital role in reducing bias and enhancing performance, their formulation and management remain underexplored, leading to inconsistencies, safety risks, and regulatory concerns. Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability. It also contributes to the emerging fields of Software Engineering (SE for AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE for AI) by bridging the gap between RE and AI in a timely and much-needed manner.","['Hina Saeeda', 'Mazen Mohamad', 'Eric Knauss', 'Jennifer Horkoff', 'Ali Nouri']",2025-11-19 20:27:30+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15859v1,1760
AI-Enabled Orchestration of Event-Driven Business Processes in Workday ERP for Healthcare Enterprises,"The adoption of cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms such as Workday has transformed healthcare operations by integrating financial, supply-chain, and workforce processes into a unified ecosystem. However, traditional workflow logic in ERP systems often lacks the adaptability required to manage event-driven and data-intensive healthcare environments.
  This study proposes an AI-enabled event-driven orchestration framework within Workday ERP that intelligently synchronizes financial and supply-chain workflows across distributed healthcare entities. The framework employs machine-learning triggers, anomaly detection, and process mining analytics to anticipate and automate responses to operational events such as inventory depletion, payment delays, or patient demand fluctuations. A multi-organization case analysis demonstrates measurable gains in process efficiency, cost visibility, and decision accuracy.
  Results confirm that embedding AI capabilities into Workday's event-based architecture enhances operational resilience, governance, and scalability. The proposed model contributes to the broader understanding of intelligent ERP integration and establishes a reference for next-generation automation strategies in healthcare enterprises.",['Monu Sharma'],2025-11-19 20:18:10+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15852v1,1273
"A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in \llm-Generated Code","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.
  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.","['Alejandro Velasco', 'Daniel Rodriguez-Cardenas', 'Dipin Khati', 'David N.

Quantum-Guided Test Case Minimization for LLM-Based Code Generation,"Precisely controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate efficient and concise code is a central challenge in software engineering. We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. This QUBO paradigm is compatible with both classical solvers and emerging hardware such as quantum annealers. Experimentally, quantum annealing solves the core TCM task 16 times faster than simulated annealing. This performance underpins our end-to-end framework, which reduces total token consumption by 36.5\% and significantly improves code quality. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between generative AI and combinatorial optimization in software engineering, highlighting the critical importance of precise model formulation.","['Huixiang Zhang', 'Mahzabeen Emu']",2025-11-19 18:00:44+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15665v1,997
EPSO: A Caching-Based Efficient Superoptimizer for BPF Bytecode,"Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) allows developers to extend Linux kernel functionality without modifying its source code. To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them. Additionally, EPSO reduces program runtime by an average of 6.60 percent, improving throughput and lowering latency in network applications.","['Qian Zhu', 'Yuxuan Liu', 'Ziyuan Zhu', 'Shangqing Liu', 'Lei Bu']",2025-11-19 16:21:20+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15589v1,1594
Identifying the Supply Chain of AI for Trustworthiness and Risk Management in Critical Applications,"Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to ""consider the right questions"" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.","['Raymond K.

MutDafny: A Mutation-Based Approach to Assess Dafny Specifications,"This paper explores the use of mutation testing to reveal weaknesses in formal specifications written in Dafny. In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.
  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.","['Isabel Amaral', 'Alexandra Mendes', 'José Campos']",2025-11-19 12:58:06+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15403v1,1323
From Machine Learning Documentation to Requirements: Bridging Processes with Requirements Languages,"In software engineering processes for machine learning (ML)-enabled systems, integrating and verifying ML components is a major challenge. A prerequisite is the specification of ML component requirements, including models and data, an area where traditional requirements engineering (RE) processes face new obstacles. An underexplored source of RE-relevant information in this context is ML documentation such as ModelCards and DataSheets. However, it is uncertain to what extent RE-relevant information can be extracted from these documents. This study first investigates the amount and nature of RE-relevant information in 20 publicly available ModelCards and DataSheets. We show that these documents contain a significant amount of potentially RE-relevant information. Next, we evaluate how effectively three established RE representations (EARS, Rupp's template, and Volere) can structure this knowledge into requirements. Our results demonstrate that there is a pathway to transform ML-specific knowledge into structured requirements, incorporating ML documentation in software engineering processes for ML systems.","['Yi Peng', 'Hans-Martin Heyn', 'Jennifer Horkoff']",2025-11-19 10:59:28+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15340v1,1120
A Viable Paradigm of Software Automation: Iterative End-to-End Automated Software Development,"Software development automation is a long-term goal in software engineering. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more researchers are exploring approaches to software automation. They view AI systems as tools or assistants in software development, still requiring significant human involvement. Another initiative is ``vibe coding'', where AI systems write and repeatedly revise most (or even all) of the code. We foresee these two development paths will converge towards the same destination: AI systems participate in throughout the software development lifecycle, expanding boundaries of full-stack software development. In this paper, we present a vision of an iterative end-to-end automated software development paradigm AutoSW. It operates in an analyze-plan-implement-deliver loop, where AI systems as human partners become first-class actors, translating human intentions expressed in natural language into executable software. We explore a lightweight prototype across the paradigm and initially execute various representative cases. The results indicate that AutoSW can successfully deliver executable software, providing a feasible direction for truly end-to-end automated software development.","['Jia Li', 'Zhi Jin', 'Kechi Zhang', 'Huangzhao Zhang', 'Jiaru Qian', 'Tiankuo Zhao']",2025-11-19 09:57:49+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15293v1,1232
"M, Toolchain and Language for Reusable Model Compilation","Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.","['Hiep Hong Trinh', 'Federico Ciccozzi', 'Abu Naser Masud', 'Marjan Sirjani', 'Mikael Sjödin']",2025-11-19 09:21:46+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15257v1,1840
Rethinking Kernel Program Repair: Benchmarking and Enhancing LLMs with RGym,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated program repair (APR) but current benchmarks like SWE-Bench predominantly focus on userspace applications and overlook the complexities of kernel-space debugging and repair. The Linux kernel poses unique challenges due to its monolithic structure, concurrency, and low-level hardware interactions. Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug. We further conduct an ablation study to analyze contributions from our proposed localization strategy, prompt structure, and model choice, and demonstrate that feedback-based retries can significantly enhance success rates.","['Kareem Shehada', 'Yifan Wu', 'Wyatt D.

"From Code Smells to Best Practices: Tackling Resource Leaks in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras","Much of the existing ML research focuses on model performance metrics, leaving limited attention to the long-term sustainability and resource efficiency of ML applications. While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them. The contributions support developers in building more efficient and sustainable ML applications and offer a structured view of the underlying causes of resource leaks.","['Bashar Abdallah', 'Martyna E.

Modelling and Model-Checking a ROS2 Multi-Robot System using Timed Rebeca,"Model-based development enables quicker prototyping, earlier experimentation and validation of design intents. For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems.","['Hiep Hong Trinh', 'Marjan Sirjani', 'Federico Ciccozzi', 'Abu Naser Masud', 'Mikael Sjödin']",2025-11-19 08:28:30+00:00,cs.RO,2511.15227v1,1445
Finetuning LLMs for Automatic Form Interaction on Web-Browser in Selenium Testing Framework,"Automated web application testing is a critical component of modern software development, with frameworks like Selenium widely adopted for validating functionality through browser automation. Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for future research on LLM-based web testing and provides resources to support ongoing progress in this area.","['Nguyen-Khang Le', 'Hiep Nguyen', 'Ngoc-Minh Nguyen', 'Son T.

"Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration Achieves Deterministic, High-Quality Decision Support for Incident Response","Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response.

Effective Code Membership Inference for Code Completion Models via Adversarial Prompts,"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on code completion models offer an effective way to assess privacy risks by inferring whether a given code snippet was part of the training data. Existing black- and gray-box MIAs rely on expensive surrogate models or manually crafted heuristic rules, which limit their ability to capture the nuanced memorization patterns exhibited by over-parameterized code language models. To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%. In addition, our method exhibits strong transferability across different models and datasets, underscoring its practical utility and generalizability.","['Yuan Jiang', 'Zehao Li', 'Shan Huang', 'Christoph Treude', 'Xiaohong Su', 'Tiantian Wang']",2025-11-19 04:30:54+00:00,cs.SE,2511.15107v1,1423

MermaidSeqBench: An Evaluation Benchmark for LLM-to-Mermaid Sequence Diagram Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in generating structured diagrams from natural language descriptions. In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark.

It's LIT! Reliability-Optimized LLMs with Inspectable Tools,"Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.","['Ruixin Zhang', 'Jon Donnelly', 'Zhicheng Guo', 'Ghazal Khalighinejad', 'Haiyang Huang', 'Alina Jade Barnett', 'Cynthia Rudin']",2025-11-18 20:41:58+00:00,cs.LG,2511.14903v1,1721
Why Do We Code?

Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment.

Towards A Catalogue of Requirement Patterns for Space Robotic Missions,"In the development of safety and mission-critical systems, including autonomous space robotic missions, complex behaviour is captured during the requirements elicitation phase. Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations.","['Mahdi Etumi', 'Hazel M.

Watchdogs and Oracles: Runtime Verification Meets Large Language Models for Autonomous Systems,"Assuring the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems is particularly difficult when learning-enabled components and open environments are involved. Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.",['Angelo Ferrando'],2025-11-18 12:35:05+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14435v1,1051
Safe-ROS: An Architecture for Autonomous Robots in Safety-Critical Domains,"Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains requires architectures that ensure operational effectiveness and safety compliance. In this paper, we contribute the Safe-ROS architecture for developing reliable and verifiable autonomous robots in such domains. It features two distinct subsystems: (1) an intelligent control system that is responsible for normal/routine operations, and (2) a Safety System consisting of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) that provide formally verifiable independent oversight. We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system. Our results demonstrate that the  Safe-ROS architecture can provide safety verifiable oversight while deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains, offering a robust framework that can be extended to additional requirements and various applications.","['Diana C.

How Does Cognitive Capability and Personality Influence Problem-Solving in Coding Interview Puzzles?,"Software engineering is a deeply cognitive activity shaped by individual differences that extend beyond technical skill. This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation. We highlight directions for future research such as longitudinal and task diverse replications with larger samples.","['Dulaji Hidellaarachchi', 'Sebastian Baltes', 'John Grundy']",2025-11-18 11:13:36+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14367v1,1888
Towards LLM-Based Usability Analysis for Recommender User Interfaces,"Usability is a key factor in the effectiveness of recommender systems. However, the analysis of user interfaces is a time-consuming process that requires expertise. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to automate such evaluations. In this work, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs to assess the usability of recommender system interfaces by considering a variety of publicly available systems as examples. We take user interface screenshots from multiple of these recommender platforms to cover both preference elicitation and recommendation presentation scenarios. An LLM is instructed to analyze these interfaces with regard to different usability criteria and provide explanatory feedback. Our evaluation demonstrates how LLMs can support heuristic-style usability assessments at scale to support the improvement of user experience.","['Sebastian Lubos', 'Alexander Felfernig', 'Damian Garber', 'Viet-Man Le', 'Thi Ngoc Trang Tran']",2025-11-18 11:05:13+00:00,cs.HC,2511.14359v1,896
KTester: Leveraging Domain and Testing Knowledge for More Effective LLM-based Test Generation,"Automated unit test generation using large language models (LLMs) holds great promise but often struggles with generating tests that are both correct and maintainable in real-world projects. This paper presents KTester, a novel framework that integrates project-specific knowledge and testing domain knowledge to enhance LLM-based test generation. Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases. Human evaluators also rate the tests produced by KTester significantly higher in terms of correctness, readability, and maintainability, confirming the practical advantages of our knowledge-driven framework.","['Anji Li', 'Mingwei Liu', 'Zhenxi Chen', 'Zheng Pei', 'Zike Li', 'Dekun Dai', 'Yanlin Wang', 'Zibin Zheng']",2025-11-18 07:57:58+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14224v1,1483
A Practical Implementation of Customized Scrum-Based Agile Framework in Aerospace Software Development Under DO-178C Constraints,"The increasing complexity of aerospace systems requires development processes that balance agility with stringent safety and certification demands. This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management. Future research should expand validation of this framework across the aerospace domain and other safety-critical industries with similar certification requirements.",['Malik Muhammad Umer'],2025-11-18 07:45:34+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14215v1,1734
Technique to Baseline QE Artefact Generation Aligned to Quality Metrics,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Quality Engineering (QE) by automating the generation of artefacts such as requirements, test cases, and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) scenarios. However, ensuring the quality of these outputs remains a challenge. This paper presents a systematic technique to baseline and evaluate QE artefacts using quantifiable metrics. The approach combines LLM-driven generation, reverse generation , and iterative refinement guided by rubrics technique for clarity, completeness, consistency, and testability. Experimental results across 12 projects show that reverse-generated artefacts can outperform low-quality inputs and maintain high standards when inputs are strong.

LogPurge: Log Data Purification for Anomaly Detection via Rule-Enhanced Filtering,"Log anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying system failures and preempting security breaches, detects irregular patterns within large volumes of log data, and impacts domains such as service reliability, performance optimization, and database log analysis. Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.","['Shenglin Zhang', 'Ziang Chen', 'Zijing Que', 'Yilun Liu', 'Yongqian Sun', 'Sicheng Wei', 'Dan Pei', 'Hailin Li']",2025-11-18 02:41:18+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14062v1,1751
"Keeping Code-Aware LLMs Fresh: Full Refresh, In-Context Deltas, and Incremental Fine-Tuning","Modern codebases evolve continuously: files are renamed or deleted; public APIs drift; behavior shifts within otherwise familiar modules. A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.","['Pradeep Kumar Sharma', 'Ishaan Puri', 'Mantinder Jit Singh', 'Swapnil Shivaprasad', 'Hritvik Shrivastava']",2025-11-18 01:01:56+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14022v1,1636
FlakyGuard: Automatically Fixing Flaky Tests at Industry Scale,"Flaky tests that non-deterministically pass or fail waste developer time and slow release cycles. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful.","['Chengpeng Li', 'Farnaz Behrang', 'August Shi', 'Peng Liu']",2025-11-18 00:10:51+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14002v1,949
LoCoBench-Agent: An Interactive Benchmark for LLM Agents in Long-Context Software Engineering,"As large language models (LLMs) evolve into sophisticated autonomous agents capable of complex software development tasks, evaluating their real-world capabilities becomes critical. While existing benchmarks like LoCoBench~\cite{qiu2025locobench} assess long-context code understanding, they focus on single-turn evaluation and cannot capture the multi-turn interactive nature, tool usage patterns, and adaptive reasoning required by real-world coding agents. We introduce \textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents. As the first long-context LLM agent benchmark for software engineering, LoCoBench-Agent establishes a rigorous foundation for measuring agent capabilities, identifying performance gaps, and advancing autonomous software development at scale.","['Jielin Qiu', 'Zuxin Liu', 'Zhiwei Liu', 'Rithesh Murthy', 'Jianguo Zhang', 'Haolin Chen', 'Shiyu Wang', 'Ming Zhu', 'Liangwei Yang', 'Juntao Tan', 'Roshan Ram', 'Akshara Prabhakar', 'Tulika Awalgaonkar', 'Zixiang Chen', 'Zhepeng Cen', 'Cheng Qian', 'Shelby Heinecke', 'Weiran Yao', 'Silvio Savarese', 'Caiming Xiong', 'Huan Wang']",2025-11-17 23:57:24+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13998v1,1901
"Exploring the Use of ChatGPT by Computer Science Students in Software Development: Applications, Ethical Considerations, and Insights for Engineering Education","ChatGPT has been increasingly used in computer science, offering efficient support across software development tasks. While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional ""independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging"" to ""AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization."" Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools.","['Daihan Xu', 'Diana Martin']",2025-11-17 23:54:08+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13996v1,1896
Show and Tell: Prompt Strategies for Style Control in Multi-Turn LLM Code Generation,"Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.",['Jeremiah Bohr'],2025-11-17 23:01:44+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13972v1,1437
Towards Continuous Assurance with Formal Verification and Assurance Cases,"Autonomous systems must sustain justified confidence in their correctness and safety across their operational lifecycle-from design and deployment through post-deployment evolution. Traditional assurance methods often separate development-time assurance from runtime assurance, yielding fragmented arguments that cannot adapt to runtime changes or system updates - a significant challenge for assured autonomy. Towards addressing this, we propose a unified Continuous Assurance Framework that integrates design-time, runtime, and evolution-time assurance within a traceable, model-driven workflow as a step towards assured autonomy. In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability. We demonstrate our approach on a nuclear inspection robot scenario, and discuss its alignment with the Trilateral AI Principles, reflecting regulator-endorsed best practices.","['Dhaminda B.

Ontology-Driven Model-to-Model Transformation of Workflow Specifications,"Proprietary workflow modeling languages such as Smart Forms & Smart Flow hamper interoperability and reuse because they lock process knowledge into closed formats. To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.","['Francisco Abreu', 'Luís Cruz', 'Sérgio Guerreiro']",2025-11-17 18:16:19+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13661v1,1910

Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.","['Chunqiu Steven Xia', 'Zhe Wang', 'Yan Yang', 'Yuxiang Wei', 'Lingming Zhang']",2025-11-17 17:58:18+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13646v1,1834
"BIOMERO 2.0: end-to-end FAIR infrastructure for bioimaging data import, analysis, and provenance","We present BIOMERO 2.0, a major evolution of the BIOMERO framework that transforms OMERO into a FAIR-compliant (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), provenance-aware bioimaging platform. BIOMERO 2.0 integrates data import, preprocessing, analysis, and workflow monitoring through an OMERO.web plugin and containerized components.

Towards Quantum Software for Quantum Simulation,"Quantum simulation is a leading candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage over classical computation, as it is believed to provide exponentially more compute power than any classical system. It offers new means of studying the behaviour of complex physical systems, for which conventionally software-intensive simulation codes based on numerical high-performance computing are used. Instead, quantum simulations map properties and characteristics of subject systems, for instance chemical molecules, onto quantum devices that then mimic the system under study.
  Currently, the use of these techniques is largely limited to fundamental science, as the overall approach remains tailored for specific problems: We lack infrastructure and modelling abstractions that are provided by the software engineering community for other computational domains.
  In this paper, we identify critical gaps in the quantum simulation software stack-particularly the absence of general-purpose frameworks for model specification, Hamiltonian construction, and hardware-aware mappings. We advocate for a modular model-driven engineering (MDE) approach that supports different types of quantum simulation (digital and analogue), and facilitates automation, performance evaluation, and reusability.

FLOWER: Flow-Oriented Entity-Relationship Tool,"Exploring relationships across data sources is a crucial optimization for entities recognition. Since databases can store big amount of information with synthetic and organic data, serving all quantity of objects correctly is an important task to deal with. However, the decision of how to construct entity relationship model is associated with human factor. In this paper, we present flow-oriented entity-relationship tool. This is first and unique end-to-end solution that eliminates routine and resource-intensive problems of processing, creating and visualizing both of explicit and implicit dependencies for prominent SQL dialects on-the-fly. Once launched, FLOWER automatically detects built-in constraints and starting to create own correct and necessary one using dynamic sampling and robust data analysis techniques.

An LLM-based Quantitative Framework for Evaluating High-Stealthy Backdoor Risks in OSS Supply Chains,"In modern software development workflows, the open-source software supply chain contributes significantly to efficient and convenient engineering practices. With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice. However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks.","['Zihe Yan', 'Kai Luo', 'Haoyu Yang', 'Yang Yu', 'Zhuosheng Zhang', 'Guancheng Li']",2025-11-17 13:10:36+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13341v1,1395
LinkXplore: A Framework for Affordable High-Quality Blockchain Data,"Blockchain technologies are rapidly transforming both academia and industry. However, large-scale blockchain data collection remains prohibitively expensive, as many RPC providers only offer enhanced APIs with high pricing tiers that are unsuitable for budget-constrained research or industrial-scale applications, which has significantly slowed down academic studies and product development. Moreover, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework that allows flexible integration of new modules for analyzing on-chain data.
  To address these challenges, we introduce LinkXplore, the first open framework for collecting and managing on-chain data. LinkXplore enables users to bypass costly blockchain data providers by directly analyzing raw data from RPC queries or streams, thereby offering high-quality blockchain data at a fraction of the cost. Through a simple API and backend processing logic, any type of chain data can be integrated into the framework. This makes it a practical alternative for both researchers and developers with limited budgets. Code and dataset used in this project are publicly available at https://github.com/Linkis-Project/LinkXplore",['Peihao Li'],2025-11-17 12:56:07+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13318v1,1169
SAINT: Service-level Integration Test Generation with Program Analysis and LLM-based Agents,"Enterprise applications are typically tested at multiple levels, with service-level testing playing an important role in validating application functionality. Existing service-level testing tools, especially for RESTful APIs, often employ fuzzing and/or depend on OpenAPI specifications which are not readily available in real-world enterprise codebases. Moreover, these tools are limited in their ability to generate functional tests that effectively exercise meaningful scenarios. In this work, we present SAINT, a novel white-box testing approach for service-level testing of enterprise Java applications. SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints. SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests. Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage. Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop. We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation. Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT. Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation.","['Rangeet Pan', 'Raju Pavuluri', 'Ruikai Huang', 'Rahul Krishna', 'Tyler Stennett', 'Alessandro Orso', 'Saurabh SInha']",2025-11-17 12:29:42+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13305v1,1757
KForge: Program Synthesis for Diverse AI Hardware Accelerators,"GPU kernels are critical for ML performance but difficult to optimize across diverse accelerators. We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms.
  We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.","['Taras Sereda', 'Tom St. John', 'Burak Bartan', 'Natalie Serrino', 'Sachin Katti', 'Zain Asgar']",2025-11-17 11:46:43+00:00,cs.LG,2511.13274v1,1283
Examining the Usage of Generative AI Models in Student Learning Activities for Software Programming,"The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT has created new opportunities and challenges for computing education. Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool. Our study highlights the urgent need for guidance when integrating GenAI into programming education to foster deeper understanding.","['Rufeng Chen', 'Shuaishuai Jiang', 'Jiyun Shen', 'AJung Moon', 'Lili Wei']",2025-11-17 11:42:24+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13271v1,1512

Agent-Oriented Visual Programming for the Web of Things,"In this paper we introduce and discuss an approach for multi-agent-oriented visual programming. This aims at enabling individuals without programming experience but with knowledge in specific target domains to design and (re)configure autonomous software. We argue that, compared to procedural programming, it should be simpler for users to create programs when agent abstractions are employed. The underlying rationale is that these abstractions, and specifically the belief-desire-intention architecture that is aligned with human practical reasoning, match more closely with people's everyday experience in interacting with other agents and artifacts in the real world. On top of this, we designed and implemented a visual programming system for agents that hides the technicalities of agent-oriented programming using a blocks-based visual development environment that is built on the JaCaMo platform. To further validate the proposed solution, we integrate the Web of Things (WoT) to let users create autonomous behaviour on top of physical mashups of devices, following the trends in industrial end-user programming. Finally, we report on a pilot user study where we verified that novice users are indeed able to make use of this development environment to create multi-agent systems to solve simple automation tasks.","['Samuele Burattini', 'Alessandro Ricci', 'Simon Mayer', 'Danai Vachtsevanou', 'Jeremy Lemee', 'Andrei Ciortea', 'Angelo Croatti']",2025-11-17 09:06:00+00:00,cs.HC,2511.13158v1,1323
Towards Requirements Engineering for GenAI-Enabled Software: Bridging Responsibility Gaps through Human Oversight Requirements,"Context: Responsibility gaps, long-recognized challenges in socio-technical systems where accountability becomes diffuse or ambiguous, have become increasingly pronounced in GenAI-enabled software. The generative and adaptive nature complicates how human oversight and responsibility are specified, delegated, and traced. Existing requirements engineering (RE) approaches remain limited in addressing these phenomena, revealing conceptual, methodological, and artifact-level research gaps.. Objective: This study aims to analyze these research gaps in the context of GenAI-enabled software systems. It seeks to establish a coherent perspective for a systematic analysis of responsibility gaps from a human oversight requirements standpoint, encompassing how these responsibility gaps should be conceptualized, identified, and represented throughout the RE process. Methods: The proposed design methodology is structured across three analytical layers. At the conceptualization layer, it establishes a conceptual framing that defines the key elements of responsibility across the human and system dimensions and explains how potential responsibility gaps emerge from their interactions. At the methodological layer, it introduces a deductive pipeline for identifying responsibility gaps by analyzing interactions between these dimensions and deriving corresponding oversight requirements within established RE frameworks. At the artifact layer, it formalizes the results in a Deductive Backbone Table, a reusable representation that traces the reasoning path from responsibility gaps identification to human oversight requirements derivation. Results: A user study compared the proposed methodology with a baseline goal-oriented RE across two scenarios. Evaluation across six dimensions indicated clear improvements of the proposed methodology, confirming its effectiveness in addressing three research gaps.","['Zhenyu Mao', 'Jacky Keung', 'Yicheng Sun', 'Yifei Wang', 'Shuo Liu', 'Jialong Li']",2025-11-17 07:14:01+00:00,cs.SE,2511.13069v1,1907
SmartPoC: Generating Executable and Validated PoCs for Smart Contract Bug Reports,"Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities and are analyzed by experts as well as automated systems, such as static analysis and AI-assisted solutions. However, audit artifacts are heterogeneous and often lack reproducible, executable PoC tests suitable for automated validation, leading to costly, ad hoc manual verification. Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to turn audit reports into PoC test cases, but have three major challenges: noisy inputs, hallucinations, and missing runtime oracles. In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively. Applied to the latest Etherscan verified-source corpus, SmartPoC confirms 236 real bugs out of 545 audit findings at a cost of only $0.03 per finding.","['Longfei Chen', 'Ruibin Yan', 'Taiyu Wong', 'Yiyang Chen', 'Chao Zhang']",2025-11-17 05:37:20+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12993v1,1346
Diffploit: Facilitating Cross-Version Exploit Migration for Open Source Library Vulnerabilities,"Exploits are commonly used to demonstrate the presence of library vulnerabilities and validate their impact across different versions. However, their direct application to alternative versions often fails due to breaking changes introduced during evolution. These failures stem from both changes in triggering conditions (e.g., API refactorings) and broken dynamic environments (e.g., build or runtime errors), which are challenging to interpret and adapt manually. Existing techniques primarily focus on code-level trace alignment through fuzzing, which is both time-consuming and insufficient for handling environment-level failures. Moreover, they often fall short when dealing with complicated triggering condition changes across versions. To overcome this, we propose Diffploit, an iterative, diff-driven exploit migration method structured around two key modules: the Context Module and the Migration Module. The Context Module dynamically constructs contexts derived from analyzing behavioral discrepancies between the target and reference versions, which capture the failure symptom and its related diff hunks. Leveraging these contexts, the Migration Module guides an LLM-based adaptation through an iterative feedback loop, balancing exploration of diff candidates and gradual refinement to resolve reproduction failures effectively. We evaluate Diffploit on a large-scale dataset containing 102 Java CVEs and 689 version-migration tasks across 79 libraries. Diffploit successfully migrates 84.2% exploits, outperforming the change-aware test repair tool TARGET by 52.0% and the rule-based tool in IDEA by 61.6%. Beyond technical effectiveness, Diffploit identifies 5 CVE reports with incorrect affected version ranges, three of which have been confirmed. It also discovers 111 unreported vulnerable versions in the GitHub Advisory Database.","['Zirui Chen', 'Zhipeng Xue', 'Jiayuan Zhou', 'Xing Hu', 'Xin Xia', 'Xiaohu Yang']",2025-11-17 04:06:01+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12950v1,1851
Agent READMEs: An Empirical Study of Context Files for Agentic Coding,"Agentic coding tools receive goals written in natural language as input, break them down into specific tasks, and write or execute the actual code with minimal human intervention. Central to this process are agent context files (""READMEs for agents"") that provide persistent, project-level instructions. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 2,303 agent context files from 1,925 repositories to characterize their structure, maintenance, and content. We find that these files are not static documentation but complex, difficult-to-read artifacts that evolve like configuration code, maintained through frequent, small additions. Our content analysis of 16 instruction types shows that developers prioritize functional context, such as build and run commands (62.3%), implementation details (69.9%), and architecture (67.7%). We also identify a significant gap: non-functional requirements like security (14.5%) and performance (14.5%) are rarely specified. These findings indicate that while developers use context files to make agents functional, they provide few guardrails to ensure that agent-written code is secure or performant, highlighting the need for improved tooling and practices.","['Worawalan Chatlatanagulchai', 'Hao Li', 'Yutaro Kashiwa', 'Brittany Reid', 'Kundjanasith Thonglek', 'Pattara Leelaprute', 'Arnon Rungsawang', 'Bundit Manaskasemsak', 'Bram Adams', 'Ahmed E.

Evaluating Generative AI for CS1 Code Grading: Direct vs Reverse Methods,"Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.
  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.
  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.","['Ahmad Memon', 'Abdallah Mohamed']",2025-11-17 01:38:06+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14798v1,1725
Human-Centred Requirements Engineering for Critical Systems: Insights from Disaster Early Warning Applications,"Critical systems, such as those used in healthcare, defence, and disaster management, demand rigorous requirements engineering to ensure safety and reliability. Yet, much of this rigour has traditionally focused on technical assurance, often overlooking the human and social contexts in which these systems operate. This paper argues that considering human-centric aspects is an essential dimension of dependability, and presents a human-centred RE process designed to integrate social responsibility into critical system development. Drawing from a literature review, we identified a set of guidelines for designing software for vulnerable communities and translated these into sixty-two functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements were operationalised through the design of an adaptive early warning system prototype, which was subsequently evaluated through six interviews and eight cognitive walkthroughs to validate their relevance and applicability. The findings demonstrate that human-centric requirements, when addressed early, enhance the usability and accessibility of systems for all users. The paper concludes by positioning human-centricity not as an ethical add-on but as a defining quality of safe and equitable critical systems.","['Anuradha Madugalla', 'Jixuan Dong', 'Kai Lyne Loi', 'Matthew Crossman', 'John Grundy']",2025-11-17 01:02:12+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12856v1,1263
Enhancing LLM Code Generation Capabilities through Test-Driven Development and Code Interpreter,"Over the past few years, improving LLM code generation capabilities has been a key focus in NLP research. Despite Bengali having 242 million native speakers worldwide, it receives little attention when it comes to training LLMs. More recently, various fine-tuning and augmented generation techniques have been employed to significantly enhance code generation performance. However, they require considerable expertise and resources to utilize effectively as an end user. The goal of our work is to democratize access to powerful code generation tools in resource-constrained emerging markets, enabling users to leverage them in their native language.
  We introduce a novel approach that combines Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Code Interpreter (CI), utilizing open-weight models, which improves the baseline accuracy for code generation with Bengali prompts and achieves an overall accuracy of 85%. Our approach requires no finetuning and proves that even the smallest models in the same family can attain up to 98% accuracy compared to the largest models.

LLM4SCREENLIT: Recommendations on Assessing the Performance of Large Language Models for Screening Literature in Systematic Reviews,"Context: Large language models (LLMs) are released faster than users' ability to evaluate them rigorously. When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs.","['Lech Madeyski', 'Barbara Kitchenham', 'Martin Shepperd']",2025-11-16 15:04:50+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12635v1,1905
Can Small GenAI Language Models Rival Large Language Models in Understanding Application Behavior?,"Generative AI (GenAI) models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have transformed multiple domains, including natural language processing, software analysis, and code understanding. Their ability to analyze and generate code has enabled applications such as source code summarization, behavior analysis, and malware detection. In this study, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of both small and large GenAI language models in understanding application behavior, with a particular focus on malware detection as a representative task. While larger models generally achieve higher overall accuracy, our experiments show that small GenAI models maintain competitive precision and recall, offering substantial advantages in computational efficiency, faster inference, and deployment in resource-constrained environments. We provide a detailed comparison across metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, highlighting each model's strengths, limitations, and operational feasibility. Our findings demonstrate that small GenAI models can effectively complement large ones, providing a practical balance between performance and resource efficiency in real-world application behavior analysis.","['Mohammad Meymani', 'Hamed Jelodar', 'Parisa Hamedi', 'Roozbeh Razavi-Far', 'Ali A.

High-level reasoning while low-level actuation in Cyber-Physical Systems: How efficient is it?,"The increasing complexity of industrial information-integration systems demands software technologies that enable intelligent behaviour, real-time response, and efficient development. Although many programming languages and frameworks exist, engineers still lack sufficient empirical evidence to guide the choice of tools for advanced industrial applications. This study addresses that need by measuring and comparing worst-case execution time (WCET) and development time across six languages and frameworks: C++, Java, Jade, Jason, and fuzzy Jason BDI with both loosely and tightly coupled integration. These technologies reflect a progression from procedural and object-oriented programming to agent-based frameworks capable of symbolic and fuzzy reasoning.
  Rather than relying on broad concepts such as paradigms or orientations, the study adopts a developer-centred approach grounded in measurable outcomes. The structured comparison examines how rising abstraction levels and reasoning capabilities affect both development effort and runtime behaviour. By analysing these dimensions, the study highlights concrete trade-offs between engineering workload and execution efficiency.
  The findings show how abstraction and reasoning mechanisms shape system performance and developer productivity, offering practical insight for designing intelligent, agent-based solutions that must operate under real-time constraints and complex decision-making requirements. Overall, the study contributes evidence-based guidance for selecting software technologies in industrial informatization, supporting improved integration efficiency, maintainability, and responsiveness, and laying groundwork for future research on the interplay between language features, development dynamics, and runtime behaviour in cyber-physical and smart manufacturing systems.","['Burak Karaduman', 'Baris Tekin Tezel', 'Moharram Challenger']",2025-11-16 10:37:37+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12543v1,1848
GenSIaC: Toward Security-Aware Infrastructure-as-Code Generation with Large Language Models,"In recent years, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical approach for managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code and automation. IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.
  While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.
  To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858. Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities.","['Yikun Li', 'Matteo Grella', 'Daniel Nahmias', 'Gal Engelberg', 'Dan Klein', 'Giancarlo Guizzardi', 'Thijs van Ede', 'Andrea Continella']",2025-11-15 23:23:52+00:00,cs.CR,2511.12385v1,1800
ProofWright: Towards Agentic Formal Verification of CUDA,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automatically generate optimized CUDA kernels, substantially improving developer productivity. However, despite rapid generation, these kernels often contain subtle correctness bugs and lack formal safety guarantees. Runtime testing is inherently unreliable - limited input coverage and reward hacking can mask incorrect behavior - while manual formal verification is reliable but cannot scale to match LLM output rates, creating a critical validation bottleneck.
  We present ProofWright, an agentic verification framework that bridges this gap by integrating automated formal verification with LLM-based code generation. ProofWright provides end-to-end guarantees of memory safety, thread safety, and semantic correctness for LLM-generated CUDA kernels. On KernelBench L1, ProofWright verifies safety properties for 74% of generated kernels, uncovers subtle correctness errors missed by conventional testing, and establishes semantic equivalence for a class of element-wise kernels. With a modest overhead of 3 minutes per kernel, ProofWright demonstrates that scalable, automated formal verification of LLM-generated GPU code is feasible - offering a path toward trustworthy high-performance code generation without sacrificing developer productivity.","['Bodhisatwa Chatterjee', 'Drew Zagieboylo', 'Sana Damani', 'Siva Hari', 'Christos Kozyrakis']",2025-11-15 17:06:50+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12294v1,1308
Reducing Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Code via Semantic Triangulation,"When generating code from natural language prompts, an LLM samples programs from a probability distribution, many of which might be incorrect. Sample consensus techniques - such as majority voting or validation against generated tests or specifications - aim to identify a correct program in the sample or abstain if none is valid. However, existing methods often fail to select a correct solution when its sampling probability is low, or when the problem permits multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions. Additionally, they often fail to abstain when no correct solution is present in the sample. To overcome these limitations, we introduce semantic triangulation, which transforms a programming problem in a way that non-trivially alters its semantics while preserving an exact, verifiable mapping between solutions before and after transformation. We theoretically establish that verifying consistency across such problem transformations increases confidence that generated programs reflect accurate generalization rather than spurious statistical correlations, enabling more reliable sample consensus and abstention. On the LiveCodeBench and CodeElo benchmarks, using GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 models, semantic triangulation increases reliability of generated code by 21% compared to the method that selects only high-confidence solutions with the probability threshold 0.5, while being able to pinpoint correct solutions at sampling probabilities as low as 0.14. Apart from that, it is also the only approach to consistently form true consensus on tasks with multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions.","['Yihan Dai', 'Sijie Liang', 'Haotian Xu', 'Peichu Xie', 'Sergey Mechtaev']",2025-11-15 16:45:14+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12288v1,1608
DataOps-driven CI/CD for analytics repositories,"The proliferation of SQL for data processing has often occurred without the rigor of traditional software development, leading to siloed efforts, logic replication, and increased risk. This ad-hoc approach hampers data governance and makes validation nearly impossible. Organizations are adopting DataOps, a methodology combining Agile, Lean, and DevOps principles to address these challenges to treat analytics pipelines as production systems. However, a standardized framework for implementing DataOps is lacking. This perspective proposes a qualitative design for a DataOps-aligned validation framework. It introduces a DataOps Controls Scorecard, derived from a multivocal literature review, which distills key concepts into twelve testable controls. These controls are then mapped to a modular, extensible CI/CD pipeline framework designed to govern a single source of truth (SOT) SQL repository. The framework consists of five stages: Lint, Optimize, Parse, Validate, and Observe, each containing specific, automated checks. A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) demonstrates how each high-level control is enforced by concrete pipeline checks, ensuring qualitative completeness. This approach provides a structured mechanism for enhancing data quality, governance, and collaboration, allowing teams to scale analytics development with transparency and control.",['Dmytro Valiaiev'],2025-11-15 16:09:47+00:00,eess.SY,2511.12277v1,1370
"Reflections on the design, applications and implementations of the normative specification language eFLINT","Checking the compliance of software against laws, regulations and contracts is increasingly important and costly as the embedding of software into societal practices is getting more pervasive. Moreover, the digitalised services provided by governmental organisations and companies are governed by an increasing amount of laws and regulations, requiring highly adaptable compliance practices. A potential solution is to automate compliance using software. However, automating compliance is difficult for various reasons. Legal practices involve subjective processes such as interpretation and qualification. New laws and regulations come into effect regularly and laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, are subjected to constant revision. In addition, computational reasoning with laws requires a cross-disciplinary process involving both legal and software expertise.
  This paper reflects on the domain-specific software language eFLINT developed to experiment with novel solutions. The language combines declarative and procedural elements to reason about situations and scenarios respectively, explicates and formalises connections between legal concepts and computational concepts, and is designed to automate compliance checks both before, during and after a software system runs. The various goals and applications areas for the language give rise to (conflicting) requirements. This paper reflects on the current design of the language by recalling various applications, the requirements they imposed, and subsequent design decisions. As such, this paper reports on results and insights of an investigation that can benefit language developers within the field of automated compliance.","['L. Thomas van Binsbergen', 'Christopher A.

Actionable Warning Is Not Enough: Recommending Valid Actionable Warnings with Weak Supervision,"The use of static analysis tools has gained increasing popularity among developers in the last few years. However, the widespread adoption of static analysis tools is hindered by their high false alarm rates. Previous studies have introduced the concept of actionable warnings and built a machine-learning method to distinguish actionable warnings from false alarms. However, according to our empirical observation, the current assumption used for actionable warning(s) collection is rather shaky and inaccurate, leading to a large number of invalid actionable warnings. To address this problem, in this study, we build the first large actionable warning dataset by mining 68,274 reversions from Top-500 GitHub C repositories, we then take one step further by assigning each actionable warning a weak label regarding its likelihood of being a real bug. Following that, we propose a two-stage framework called ACWRecommender to automatically recommend the actionable warnings with high probability to be real bugs (AWHB). Our approach warms up the pre-trained model UniXcoder by identifying actionable warnings task (coarse-grained detection stage) and rerank AWHB to the top by weakly supervised learning (fine-grained reranking stage). Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several baselines by a large margin in terms of nDCG and MRR for AWHB recommendation. Moreover, we ran our tool on 6 randomly selected projects and manually checked the top-ranked warnings from 2,197 reported warnings, we reported top-10 recommended warnings to developers, 27 of them were already confirmed by developers as real bugs. Developers can quickly find real bugs among the massive amount of reported warnings, which verifies the practical usage of our tool.","['Zhipeng Xue', 'Zhipeng Gao', 'Tongtong Xu', 'Xing Hu', 'Xin Xia', 'Shanping Li']",2025-11-15 14:10:56+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12229v1,1767
irace-evo: Automatic Algorithm Configuration Extended With LLM-Based Code Evolution,"Automatic algorithm configuration tools such as irace efficiently tune parameter values but leave algorithmic code unchanged. This paper introduces a first version of irace-evo, an extension of irace that integrates code evolution through large language models (LLMs) to jointly explore parameter and code spaces. The proposed framework enables multi-language support (e.g., C++, Python), reduces token consumption via progressive context management, and employs the Always-From-Original principle to ensure robust and controlled code evolution. We evaluate irace-evo on the Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt (CMSA) metaheuristic for the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP). Experimental results show that irace-evo can discover new algorithm variants that outperform the state-of-the-art CMSA implementation while maintaining low computational and monetary costs. Notably, irace-evo generates competitive algorithmic improvements using lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku 3.5) with a total usage cost under 2 euros. These results demonstrate that coupling automatic configuration with LLM-driven code evolution provides a powerful, cost-efficient avenue for advancing heuristic design and metaheuristic optimization.","['Camilo Chacón Sartori', 'Christian Blum']",2025-11-15 12:42:18+00:00,cs.SE,2511.14794v1,1225
Multi-Agent Collaborative Fuzzing with Continuous Reflection for Smart Contracts Vulnerability Detection,"Fuzzing is a widely used technique for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, which generates transaction sequences to explore the execution paths of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers are falling short in detecting sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific attack transaction sequences with proper inputs to trigger, as they (i) prioritize code coverage over vulnerability discovery, wasting considerable effort on non-vulnerable code regions, and (ii) lack semantic understanding of stateful contracts, generating numerous invalid transaction sequences that cannot pass runtime execution.
  In this paper, we propose SmartFuzz, a novel collaborative reflective fuzzer for smart contract vulnerability detection. It employs large language model-driven agents as the fuzzing engine and continuously improves itself by learning and reflecting through interactions with the environment. Specifically, we first propose a new Continuous Reflection Process (CRP) for fuzzing smart contracts, which reforms the transaction sequence generation as a self-evolving process through continuous reflection on feedback from the runtime environment. Then, we present the Reactive Collaborative Chain (RCC) to orchestrate the fuzzing process into multiple sub-tasks based on the dependencies of transaction sequences. Furthermore, we design a multi-agent collaborative team, where each expert agent is guided by the RCC to jointly generate and refine transaction sequences from both global and local perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SmartFuzz's performance on real-world contracts and DApp projects. The results demonstrate that SmartFuzz outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools: (i) it detects 5.8\%-74.7\% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes, and (ii) it reduces false negatives by up to 80\%.","['Jie Chen', 'Liangmin Wang']",2025-11-15 11:21:56+00:00,cs.CR,2511.12164v1,1838
A Code Smell Refactoring Approach using GNNs,"Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance.","['HanYu Zhang', 'Tomoji Kishi']",2025-11-15 07:21:26+00:00,cs.SE,2511.12069v1,1510
WITNESS: A lightweight and practical approach to fine-grained predictive mutation testing,"Existing fine-grained predictive mutation testing studies predominantly rely on deep learning, which faces two critical limitations in practice: (1) Exorbitant computational costs. The deep learning models adopted in these studies demand significant computational resources for training and inference acceleration. This introduces high costs and undermines the cost-reduction goal of predictive mutation testing. (2) Constrained applicability. Although modern mutation testing tools generate mutants both inside and outside methods, current fine-grained predictive mutation testing approaches handle only inside-method mutants. As a result, they cannot predict outside-method mutants, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. We propose WITNESS, a new fine-grained predictive mutation testing approach. WITNESS adopts a twofold design: (1) With collected features from both inside-method and outside-method mutants, WITNESS is suitable for all generated mutants. (2) Instead of using computationally expensive deep learning, WITNESS employs lightweight classical machine learning models for training and prediction. This makes it more cost-effective and enabling straightforward explanations of the decision-making processes behind the adopted models. Evaluations on Defects4J projects show that WITNESS consistently achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across different scenarios. Additionally, WITNESS significantly enhances the efficiency of kill matrix prediction. Post-hoc analysis reveals that features incorporating information from before and after the mutation are the most important among those used in WITNESS. Test case prioritization based on the predicted kill matrix shows that WITNESS delivers results much closer to those obtained by using the actual kill matrix, outperforming baseline approaches.","['Zeyu Lu', 'Peng Zhang', 'Chun Yong Chong', 'Shan Gao', 'Yibiao Yang', 'Yanhui Li', 'Lin Chen', 'Yuming Zhou']",2025-11-15 02:38:00+00:00,cs.SE,2511.11999v1,1840
VULPO: Context-Aware Vulnerability Detection via On-Policy LLM Optimization,"The widespread reliance on open-source software dramatically increases the risk of vulnerability exploitation, underscoring the need for effective and scalable vulnerability detection (VD). Existing VD techniques, whether traditional machine learning-based or LLM-based approaches like prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, or off-policy preference optimization, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform context-aware analysis: They depend on fixed inputs or static preference datasets, cannot adaptively explore repository-level dependencies, and are constrained by function-level benchmarks that overlook critical vulnerability context.
  This paper introduces Vulnerability-Adaptive Policy Optimization (VULPO), an on-policy LLM reinforcement learning framework for context-aware VD. To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy optimization, improving F1 by 85% over Qwen3-4B and achieving performance comparable to a 150x larger-scale model, DeepSeek-R1-0528.","['Youpeng Li', 'Fuxun Yu', 'Xinda Wang']",2025-11-14 21:57:48+00:00,cs.CR,2511.11896v2,1883
CertiA360: Enhance Compliance Agility in Aerospace Software Development,"Agile methods are characterised by iterative and incremental processes with a strong focus on flexibility and accommodating changing requirements based on either technical, regulatory, or stakeholder feedback. However, integrating Agile methods into safety-critical system development in the aerospace industry presents substantial challenges due to its strict compliance requirements, such as those outlined in the DO-178C standard. To achieve this vision, the flexibility of Agile must align with the rigorous certification guidelines, which emphasize documentation, traceability of requirements across different levels and disciplines, and comprehensive verification and validation (V&V) activities. The research work described in this paper proposes a way of using the strengths of the flexible nature of Agile methods to automate and manage change requests throughout the whole software development lifecycle, ensuring robust traceability, regulatory compliance and ultimately facilitating successful certification. This study proposes CertiA360, a tool designed to help teams improve requirement maturity, automate the changes in traceability, and align with the regulatory objectives. The tool was designed and validated in close collaboration with aerospace industry experts, using their feedback to ensure practical application and real-life effectiveness. The feedback collected demonstrated that the automation given by CertiA360 may reduce manual effort and allow response to changing requirements while ensuring compliance with DO-178C. While the tool is not yet qualified under DO-330 (Tool Qualification), findings suggest that when tailored appropriately, Agile methods can not only coexist with the requirements of safety-system development and certification in highly regulated domains like aerospace, but also add efficiency.","['J.

SCRUTINEER: Detecting Logic-Level Usage Violations of Reusable Components in Smart Contracts,"Smart Contract Reusable Components(SCRs) play a vital role in accelerating the development of business-specific contracts by promoting modularity and code reuse. However, the risks associated with SCR usage violations have become a growing concern. One particular type of SCR usage violation, known as a logic-level usage violation, is becoming especially harmful. This violation occurs when the SCR adheres to its specified usage rules but fails to align with the specific business logic of the current context, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Detecting such violations necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the contract's business logic, including the ability to extract implicit usage patterns and analyze fine-grained logical behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose SCRUTINEER, the first automated and practical system for detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs. First, we design a composite feature extraction approach that produces three complementary feature representations, supporting subsequent analysis. We then introduce a Large Language Model-powered knowledge construction framework, which leverages comprehension-oriented prompts and domain-specific tools to extract logic-level usage and build the SCR knowledge base. Next, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-driven inspector, which combines a rapid retrieval strategy with both comprehensive and targeted analysis to identify potentially insecure logic-level usages. Finally, we implement a logic-level usage violation analysis engine that integrates a similarity-based checker and a snapshot-based inference conflict checker to enable accurate and robust detection. We evaluate SCRUTINEER from multiple perspectives on 3 ground-truth datasets. The results show that SCRUTINEER achieves a precision of 80.77%, a recall of 82.35%, and an F1-score of 81.55% in detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs.","['Xingshuang Lin', 'Binbin Zhao', 'Jinwen Wang', 'Qinge Xie', 'Xibin Zhao', 'Shouling Ji']",2025-11-14 15:41:56+00:00,cs.SE,2511.11411v1,1917
Library Liberation: Competitive Performance Matmul Through Compiler-composed Nanokernels,"The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.","['Arun Thangamani', 'Md Asghar Ahmad Shahid', 'Adam Siemieniuk', 'Rolf Morel', 'Renato Golin', 'Alexander Heinecke']",2025-11-14 14:32:28+00:00,cs.LG,2511.13764v1,1180
Enabling Predictive Maintenance in District Heating Substations: A Labelled Dataset and Fault Detection Evaluation Framework based on Service Data,"Early detection of faults in district heating substations is imperative to reduce return temperatures and enhance efficiency. However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.
  The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.
  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.","['Cyriana M.

SQuaD: The Software Quality Dataset,"Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics.

Utilizing LLMs for Industrial Process Automation: A Case Study on Modifying RAPID Programs,"How to best use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering is covered in many publications in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, is still underexplored. Within this paper, we study enterprises can achieve on their own without investing large amounts of effort into the training of models specific to the domain-specific languages that are used. We show that few-shot prompting approaches are sufficient to solve simple problems in a language that is otherwise not well-supported by an LLM and that is possible on-premise, thereby ensuring the protection of sensitive company data.","['Salim Fares', 'Steffen Herbold']",2025-11-14 09:56:55+00:00,cs.SE,2511.11125v1,829
Data Race Detection by Digest-Driven Abstract Interpretation (Extended Version),"Sound static analysis can prove the absence of data races by establishing that no two conflicting memory accesses can occur at the same time. We repurpose the concept of digests -- summaries of computational histories originally introduced to bring tunable concurrency-sensitivity to thread-modular value analysis by abstract interpretation, extending this idea to race detection: We use digests to capture the conditions under which conflicting accesses may not happen in parallel. To formalize this, we give a definition of data races in the thread-modular local trace semantics and show how exclusion criteria for potential conflicts can be expressed as digests. We report on our implementation of digest-driven data race detection in the static analyzer Goblint, and evaluate it on the SV-COMP benchmark suite. Combining the lockset digest with digests reasoning on thread ids and thread joins increases the number of correctly solved tasks by more than a factor of five compared to lockset reasoning alone.","['Michael Schwarz', 'Julian Erhard']",2025-11-14 08:11:31+00:00,cs.PL,2511.11055v1,1011
PATCHEVAL: A New Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Patching Real-World Vulnerabilities,"Software vulnerabilities are increasing at an alarming rate. However, manual patching is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques remain limited in effectiveness. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened a new paradigm for AVR, demonstrating remarkable progress. To examine the capability of LLMs in AVR, several vulnerability benchmarks have been proposed recently. However, they still suffer from key limitations of outdated vulnerabilities, limited language coverage, unreliable patch validation, and insufficient reproducibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PATCHEVAL, a multilingual benchmark for Go, JavaScript, and Python, languages for which existing benchmarks remain unexplored. PATCHEVAL curates a dataset of 1,000 vulnerabilities drawn from CVEs reported between 2015 and 2025, covering 65 distinct CWEs. A subset of 230 CVEs is further equipped with runtime sandbox environments, enabling patch verification through both security tests and functionality tests. To provide a systematic comparison of LLM-based vulnerability repair, we evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and agents, presenting an in-depth analysis that empirically yields key insights to guide future research in AVR.","['Zichao Wei', 'Jun Zeng', 'Ming Wen', 'Zeliang Yu', 'Kai Cheng', 'Yiding Zhu', 'Jingyi Guo', 'Shiqi Zhou', 'Le Yin', 'Xiaodong Su', 'Zhechao Ma']",2025-11-14 07:14:32+00:00,cs.CR,2511.11019v1,1303
Automata-Based Steering of Large Language Models for Diverse Structured Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs.

We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns.

Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Dynamics of Agentic Multi-Hunk Repair,"Automated program repair has traditionally focused on single-hunk defects, overlooking multi-hunk bugs that are prevalent in real-world systems. Repairing these bugs requires coordinated edits across multiple, disjoint code regions, posing substantially greater challenges. We present the first systematic study of LLM-driven coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-cli, and Qwen Code) on this task. We evaluate these agents on 372 multi-hunk bugs from the Hunk4J dataset, analyzing 1,488 repair trajectories using fine-grained metrics that capture localization, repair accuracy, regression behavior, and operational dynamics. Results reveal substantial variation: repair accuracy ranges from 25.8% (Qwen Code) to 93.3% (Claude Code) and consistently declines with increasing bug dispersion and complexity. High-performing agents demonstrate superior semantic consistency, achieving positive regression reduction, whereas lower-performing agents often introduce new test failures. Notably, agents do not fail fast; failed repairs consume substantially more resources (39%-343% more tokens) and require longer execution time (43%-427%). Additionally, we developed Maple to provide agents with repository-level context. Empirical results show that Maple improves the repair accuracy of Gemini-cli by 30% through enhanced localization. By analyzing fine-grained metrics and trajectory-level analysis, this study moves beyond accuracy to explain how coding agents localize, reason, and act during multi-hunk repair.","['Noor Nashid', 'Daniel Ding', 'Keheliya Gallaba', 'Ahmed E.

From Proof to Program: Characterizing Tool-Induced Reasoning Hallucinations in Large Language Models,"Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

Architecting software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through large language models and conformance checking,"Context: Ensuring high levels of dependability in modern computer-based systems has become increasingly challenging due to their complexity. Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to ""unknown unknowns"".
  Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.
  Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.
  Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.
  Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking.","['Francesco Vitale', 'Francesco Flammini', 'Mauro Caporuscio', 'Nicola Mazzocca']",2025-11-14 01:11:26+00:00,cs.SE,2511.10876v1,1873
Towards a Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Reliable Patch Evaluation Using an LLM-as-a-Judge,"Reliable evaluation is crucial for advancing Automated Program Repair (APR), but prevailing benchmarks rely on execution-based evaluation methods (unit test pass@k), which fail to capture true patch validity. Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels. On the full dataset including patches where human raters disagree, we find this approach can still be further improved (Cohen's kappa 0.57, recall 0.93, precision 0.65) and identify possible future directions.","['Sherry Shi', 'Renyao Wei', 'Michele Tufano', 'José Cambronero', 'Runxiang Cheng', 'Franjo Ivančić', 'Pat Rondon']",2025-11-14 00:22:04+00:00,cs.SE,2511.10865v1,1231
HPCAgentTester: A Multi-Agent LLM Approach for Enhanced HPC Unit Test Generation,"Unit testing in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is critical but challenged by parallelism, complex algorithms, and diverse hardware. Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems.","['Rabimba Karanjai', 'Lei Xu', 'Weidong Shi']",2025-11-13 23:52:53+00:00,cs.DC,2511.10860v1,1257
AFLGopher: Accelerating Directed Fuzzing via Feasibility-Aware Guidance,"Directed fuzzing is a useful testing technique that aims to efficiently reach target code sites in a program. The core of directed fuzzing is the guiding mechanism that directs the fuzzing to the specified target. A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \emph{feasibility-unaware}.
  In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision. We implemented AFLGopher and compared AFLGopher with state-of-the-art directed fuzzers including AFLGo, enhanced AFLGo, WindRanger, BEACON and SelectFuzz. AFLGopher is 3.76x, 2.57x, 3.30x, 2.52x and 2.86x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in reaching targets.

Bridging the Skills Gap: A Course Model for Modern Generative AI Education,"Research on how the popularization of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools impacts learning environments has led to hesitancy among educators to teach these tools in classrooms, creating two observed disconnects. Generative AI competency is increasingly valued in industry but not in higher education, and students are experimenting with generative AI without formal guidance. The authors argue students across fields must be taught to responsibly and expertly harness the potential of AI tools to ensure job market readiness and positive outcomes. Computer Science trajectories are particularly impacted, and while consistently top ranked U.S. Computer Science departments teach the mechanisms and frameworks underlying AI, few appear to offer courses on applications for existing generative AI tools. A course was developed at a private research university to teach undergraduate and graduate Computer Science students applications for generative AI tools in software development. Two mixed method surveys indicated students overwhelmingly found the course valuable and effective. Co-authored by the instructor and one of the graduate students, this paper explores the context, implementation, and impact of the course through data analysis and reflections from both perspectives. It additionally offers recommendations for replication in and beyond Computer Science departments. This is the extended version of this paper to include technical appendices.","['Anya Bardach', 'Hamilton Murrah']",2025-11-13 21:24:54+00:00,cs.CY,2511.11757v1,1466
Peer Code Review in Research Software Development: The Research Software Engineer Perspective,"Background: Research software is crucial for enabling research discoveries and supporting data analysis, simulation, and interpretation across domains. However, evolving requirements, complex inputs, and legacy dependencies hinder the software quality and maintainability. While peer code review can improve software quality, its adoption by research software engineers (RSEs) remains unexplored. Aims: This study explores RSE perspectives on peer code review, focusing on their practices, challenges, and potential improvements. Building on prior work, it aims to uncover how RSEs insights differ from those of other research software developers and identify factors that can enhance code review adoption in this domain. Method: We surveyed RSEs to gather insights into their perspectives on peer code review. The survey design aligned with previous research to enable comparative analysis while including additional questions tailored to RSEs. Results: We received 61 valid responses from the survey. The findings align with prior research while uncovering unique insights about the challenges and practices of RSEs compared to broader developer groups. Conclusions: Peer code review is vital in improving research software's quality, maintainability, and reliability. Despite the unique challenges RSEs face, addressing these through structured processes, improved tools, and targeted training can enhance peer review adoption and effectiveness in research software development.","['Md Ariful Islam Malik', 'Jeffrey C.
